John Pappalardo, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n              \n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per  curiam.     After  a   five-day  jury   trial,\n                     \n\ndefendant-appellant   Jaime   Corrales   was   convicted   of\n\nconspiracy to  possess cocaine  with intent to  distribute in\n\nviolation  of 21 U.S.C.   846, and possession of cocaine with\n\nintent   to  distribute   in   violation  of   21  U.S.C.    \n\n841(a)(1)(2).  On appeal,  defendant argues that the district\n\ncourt erroneously limited the  scope of his cross-examination\n\nof  the government's  confidential informant  and asks  us to\n\nvacate his conviction.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Before beginning  work as a  confidential informant\n\nwith  the  federal Drug  Enforcement  Administration (\"DEA\"),\n\nJaime Echevarria was arrested on  two separate occasions:  in\n\n1990 for drug  trafficking and in  1991 as part of  a federal\n\ndrug  conspiracy  sting.   Both  times,  the charges  against\n\nEchevarria were  dismissed.  In particular,  the 1991 charges\n\nwere  dismissed after  a finding  of no  probable cause  by a\n\nUnited   States  Magistrate   Judge.1     Echevarria's  wife,\n\nBeatrice Lopez, was  also arrested  in the 1991  sting.   Her\n\nindictment was  not dismissed, however, and  she subsequently\n\npleaded guilty  to a  charge  of conspiracy  to possess  with\n\nintent to distribute cocaine.   \n\n                    \n\n1.  The record  before us provides no  further elaboration on\nthe grounds for dismissal.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          Some  days after  Echevarria's  1991  charges  were\n\ndismissed, he was approached by DEA agents offering financial\n\ncompensation  and  a  promise  to  consider  reducing Lopez's\n\nsentence in exchange for  Echevarria's work as a confidential\n\ninformant.   Echevarria  agreed.   In  his first  assignment,\n\nEchevarria posed  as a  drug buyer in  Lowell, Massachusetts,\n\nwhere  he negotiated  to buy  ten kilograms  of  cocaine from\n\ndefendant  and  two  others.   As  a  result  of Echevarria's\n\ncooperation, defendant was arrested and brought to trial.\n\n          Echevarria was the  government's principal  witness\n\nat  trial.     Prior  to  defendant's   cross-examination  of\n\nEchevarria,  the government,  in accordance  with  the Jencks\n                                                             \n\nAct2,  provided  defendant  with a  summary  of  Echevarria's\n   \n\ncriminal  history and  all inducements.   At  this time,  the\n\ngovernment  also  sought,  through  a motion  in  limine,  to\n                                                        \n\nprevent defendant  from  asking Echevarria  about  his  prior\n\nunprosecuted  arrests.  Before  the trial court  ruled on the\n\nmotion,  defendant's attorney  stated to  the court  that she\n\nwould not  ask Echevarria about unprosecuted arrests provided\n\nthat the government's  decision not to prosecute was  not the\n\nproduct  of an  agreement to  cooperate.   At this  time, the\n\ngovernment reiterated the information contained in the Jencks\n                                                             \n\nAct  materials  by  assuring  both defense  counsel  and  the\n   \n\n                    \n\n2.  See  18 U.S.C.   3500  et seq.; Jencks  v. United States,\n                                                            \n353 U.S. 657 (1957).\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\ndistrict court that the dismissal of the 1991 charges against\n\nEchevarria resulted  from a  lack of probable  cause and  not\n                                                             \n\nfrom any such agreement.  \n\n          Nonetheless,  before  cross-examining   Echevarria,\n\nCorrales  requested (and  was  granted) a  voir  dire of  the\n\nwitness.   In  response  to  counsel's questions,  Echevarria\n\nemphatically denied any collusion  between the government and\n\nhimself  regarding  the 1991  dismissal.   Echevarria further\n\nstated  that  he  had  not  been  approached  by  DEA  agents\n\nconcerning  his possible  cooperation  until days  after  the\n\ncharges  were dropped.  At  the conclusion of  the voir dire,\n\nthe government again declared that  the dismissal of the 1991\n\ncharges  against Echevarria  resulted  from a  finding of  no\n\nprobable cause by a Magistrate Judge.\n\n          Following  voir  dire,  defendant's counsel  cross-\n\nexamined  Echevarria about the  circumstances leading  to his\n\nwife's  indictment.    After  denying  knowledge  of specific\n\nevents,  Echevarria explained  that he  was not aware  of his\n\nwife's  actions because  he  was \"innocent  of [her  crime].\"\n\nCounsel  then  attempted  to  impeach  this  proclamation  of\n\ninnocence  by  questioning  Echevarria in  detail  about  the\n\nsubstance of a  phone call  between Lopez and  her cousin  --\n\nevidence  which   apparently   served  as   the   basis   for\n\nEchevarria's wife's indictment.  The government objected  and\n\nthe following bench conference ensued:\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          [Defense Counsel]:  I think I am entitled\n          to  ask him  about his  activities around\n          drugs   and   his  information   and  his\n          knowledge, and it is  an exception to the\n          conviction; because, your Honor, I am not\n          introducing it  for  the purpose  of  bad\n          character, which is why  only convictions\n          are allowed.\n\n          Court:  You are trying to establish --\n\n          [Defense Counsel]:  He     himself    was\n          involved.\n\n          Court:    If  you  can establish  he  was\n          involved, that is something else again.\n\n          [Defense  Counsel]:    I  believe   I  am\n          entitled  to  that, because,  although he\n          was not convicted of  a drug crime, it is\n          not being offered for purposes of proving\n          his  bad character,  which  is  what  the\n          hearsay rule is for.\n\n          Court:  What is the relevance then?\n\n          [Defense  Counsel]:  The  relevance is it\n          shows a motive for him.\n\n          Court:  His motive  may be to protect his\n          wife.  You can establish that, but on the\n          record he has already been dismissed from\n          any  accusation, and that  controls.  You\n          don't  have a good-faith basis for trying\n          to ask  the question  so  he will  scream\n          out,  \"I  recall.    I made  a  mistake.\"\n          There is no good-faith basis for that.\n\n          You  are entitled, I  think, to establish\n          the severity of  the offense against  the\n          wife  and  his   interest  in  trying  to\n          cooperate.  That is legitimate.\n\nWithout  further  discussion,  defense  counsel  resumed  her\n\ncross-examination of  Echevarria.   She neither  attempted to\n\npresent  to the court  any evidence suggesting  that the 1991\n\ndismissal was tied to an agreement between Echevarria and the\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ngovernment, nor did she attempt to suggest that she possessed\n\nevidence to  show that  Echevarria had been  involved in  the\n\n1991 conspiracy.  Instead, counsel concentrated on  eliciting\n\nthe exact terms of Echevarria's agreement with the government\n\nand wholly  abandoned any  attempt to  ask about  his alleged\n\ninvolvement  in his  wife's  crime.   In response  to defense\n\ncounsel's questions, Echevarria acknowledged that he had been\n\npaid  $10,800 in  cash for  his cooperation  in the  case and\n\nfurther admitted that he hoped his cooperation would inure to\n\nthe benefit  of his wife  who had been  convicted of a  drug-\n\nrelated crime and was awaiting sentencing.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Defendant contends that the district court violated\n\nhis  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  confrontation  by  limiting\n\ndefense  counsel's cross-examination  of  Echevarria.    More\n\nspecifically,  defendant  claims  that  the  district court's\n\nevidentiary ruling prevented his attorney from fully exposing\n\nEchevarria's   motive   to  testify,   and   from  impeaching\n\nEchevarria  on the collateral issue of his involvement in his\n\nwife's 1991 drug activities.  \n\n          We  begin  by  noting  that   a  defendant's  Sixth\n\nAmendment right to cross-examine witnesses against him or her\n\nis  \"fundamental  and  demanding  of  great  respect,\" United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Twomey, 806 F.2d 1136,  1139 (1st Cir. 1986).  This\n                \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nright, however, is  not without limits.   \"`On the  contrary,\n\ntrial   judges   retain   wide   latitude   insofar  as   the\n\nConfrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits\n\non  . .  . cross-examination based  on concerns  about, among\n\nother things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues,\n\nthe witness'  safety, or interrogation that  is repetitive or\n\nonly marginally relevant.'\"  United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1005,  1009-10  (1st  Cir.  1993) (quoting  Delaware  v.  Van\n                                                             \n\nArsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679  (1986)).  On appeal, we review  a\n       \n\ntrial  court's  limitations upon  cross-examination  under an\n\nabuse  of discretion standard.  See Twomey, 806 F.2d at 1140.\n                                          \n\n\"In  order  to establish  that  the  trial judge  abused  his\n\ndiscretion  in limiting cross-examination, the defendant must\n\nshow that the restriction  imposed were clearly prejudicial.\"\n\nId.  Defendant makes no such showing.\n   \n\n          A  review of the  record reveals  that Echevarria's\n\nmotives for testifying were fully disclosed.  As noted above,\n\nduring  cross-examination  of  Echevarria,   defense  counsel\n\nunearthed the exact terms of the agreement between Echevarria\n\nand the government.   Thus, the jury was  afforded sufficient\n\ninformation   to   make   a   discriminating   appraisal   of\n\nEchevarria's  motives and  bias.  See  id.; United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nMcLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1992).   In the absence\n          \n\nof  any  evidence  to  suggest  that  there  were  additional\n\nagreements made  between Echevarria  and  the government,  we\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\ndisagree  with defendant's  assertion that  he was  denied an\n\nopportunity  to  fully  expose  Echevarria's   motivation  to\n\ntestify.     \n\n          Defendant's  argument  that   the  district   court\n\nimproperly  limited cross-examination  regarding Echevarria's\n\ninvolvement   in  the   1991  drug   conspiracy  is   equally\n\nunpersuasive.   Trial judges may \"limit  impeachment evidence\n\non matters that are deemed collateral or irrelevant.\"  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Walker, 930 F.2d 789, 791-92 (10th Cir. 1991); see\n                                                             \n\nalso  United States  v. Moore,  923 U.S.  910, 913  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1991)   (stating   that  the   district   court  \"has   broad\n\ndiscretionary authority to  prohibit cross-examination  where\n\nthat   cross-examination  would   introduce  into   the  case\n\ncollateral matters  that could  confuse the jury,  that would\n\nrequire   later   introduction   of  otherwise   unnecessary,\n\nadditional,  potentially clarifying  evidence, or  that might\n\nprejudice one of  the parties\").   As the  trial court  aptly\n\nnoted,  the only evidence remotely suggesting that Echevarria\n\nhad  been  involved  in  the  1991 conspiracy  was  his  1991\n\nunprosecuted  arrest.   Yet,  charges from  this arrest  were\n\ndismissed for  lack of  probable cause.   Moreover, defendant\n\nfailed  below, and  has  failed  on  appeal, to  proffer  any\n\nadditional  evidence of Echevarria's  involvement in the 1991\n\nconspiracy.  Without such a proffer, the district court acted\n\nwell  within its discretion to  hold that defendant was bound\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nby Echevarria's proclamation  of \"innocence,\"  and could  not\n\nfurther  question  Echevarria  about  this  collateral matter\n\nwithout demonstrating a good faith basis for the inquiry.3  \n\n          Finally,  defendant appears  to argue, albeit  in a\n\nperfunctory  manner,   that,  under  Fed.  R.  Evid.  608(b),\n\nevidence of  Echevarria's prior  drug involvement  should not\n\nhave been  excluded because  it was relevant  to Echevarria's\n\ncharacter for truthfulness.   We need not delay long  on this\n         \n\ncomplaint.  As we noted  in Pinkham v. Maine Cent. R.R.  Co.,\n                                                            \n\n874  F.2d  875,  879  (1st  Cir.  1989)  (collecting  cases),\n\nevidence  of a  witness's drug  involvement is  generally not\n\nadmissible for character  impeachment purposes.  Accordingly,\n\nwe see no error here.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is \n\n                    \n\n3.  Defendant alternatively argues that, under Fed. R.  Evid.\n404(b),  the evidence  of prior  drug involvement  should not\nhave been excluded.  Without reaching defendant's dubious and\nunsupported assertion  that Fed. R. Evid.  404(b) is relevant\nto a  discussion of impeachment  of a government  witness, we\n                                                         \nnote  that  \"other act\"  evidence  \"must  have some  `special\nrelevance' to  a material issue such  as motive, opportunity,\n                         \nintent, preparation, plan, or knowledge.\"  Carty, 993 F.2d at\n                                                \n1011 (emphasis  supplied).

Sec. 846, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec.  841(a)(1)(2).  On appeal, defendant argues that the district court erroneously limited the scope of his cross-examination of the government's confidential informant and asks us to vacate his conviction.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before beginning work as a confidential informant with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\"), Jaime Echevarria was arrested on two separate occasions:  in 1990 for drug trafficking and in 1991 as part of a federal drug conspiracy sting.  Both times, the charges against Echevarria were dismissed.  In particular, the 1991 charges were dismissed after a finding of no probable cause by a United States Magistrate Judge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Echevarria's wife, Beatrice Lopez, was also arrested in the 1991 sting.  Her indictment was not dismissed, however, and she subsequently pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some days after Echevarria's 1991 charges were dismissed, he was approached by DEA agents offering financial compensation and a promise to consider reducing Lopez's sentence in exchange for Echevarria's work as a confidential informant.  Echevarria agreed.  In his first assignment, Echevarria posed as a drug buyer in Lowell, Massachusetts, where he negotiated to buy ten kilograms of cocaine from defendant and two others.  As a result of Echevarria's cooperation, defendant was arrested and brought to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Echevarria was the government's principal witness at trial.  Prior to defendant's cross-examination of Echevarria, the government, in accordance with the Jencks Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>, provided defendant with a summary of Echevarria's criminal history and all inducements.  At this time, the government also sought, through a motion in limine, to prevent defendant from asking Echevarria about his prior unprosecuted arrests.  Before the trial court ruled on the motion, defendant's attorney stated to the court that she would not ask Echevarria about unprosecuted arrests provided that the government's decision not to prosecute was not the product of an agreement to cooperate.  At this time, the government reiterated the information contained in the Jencks Act materials by assuring both defense counsel and the district court that the dismissal of the 1991 charges against Echevarria resulted from a lack of probable cause and not from any such agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, before cross-examining Echevarria, Corrales requested (and was granted) a voir dire of the witness.  In response to counsel's questions, Echevarria emphatically denied any collusion between the government and himself regarding the 1991 dismissal.  Echevarria further stated that he had not been approached by DEA agents concerning his possible cooperation until days after the charges were dropped.  At the conclusion of the voir dire, the government again declared that the dismissal of the 1991 charges against Echevarria resulted from a finding of no probable cause by a Magistrate Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following voir dire, defendant's counsel cross-examined Echevarria about the circumstances leading to his wife's indictment.  After denying knowledge of specific events, Echevarria explained that he was not aware of his wife's actions because he was \"innocent of [her crime].\"  Counsel then attempted to impeach this proclamation of innocence by questioning Echevarria in detail about the substance of a phone call between Lopez and her cousin-evidence which apparently served as the basis for Echevarria's wife's indictment.  The government objected and the following bench conference ensued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>[Defense Counsel]:  I think I am entitled to ask him about his activities around drugs and his information and his knowledge, and it is an exception to the conviction;  because, your Honor, I am not introducing it for the purpose of bad character, which is why only convictions are allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Court:  You are trying to establish-</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>[Defense Counsel]: He himself was involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Court:  If you can establish he was involved, that is something else again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[Defense Counsel]:  I believe I am entitled to that, because, although he was not convicted of a drug crime, it is not being offered for purposes of proving his bad character, which is what the hearsay rule is for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Court:  What is the relevance then?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[Defense Counsel]:  The relevance is it shows a motive for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Court:  His motive may be to protect his wife.  You can establish that, but on the record he has already been dismissed from any accusation, and that controls.  You don't have a good-faith basis for trying to ask the question so he will scream out, \"I recall.  I made a mistake.\"  There is no good-faith basis for that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>You are entitled, I think, to establish the severity of the offense against the wife and his interest in trying to cooperate.  That is legitimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without further discussion, defense counsel resumed her cross-examination of Echevarria.  She neither attempted to present to the court any evidence suggesting that the 1991 dismissal was tied to an agreement between Echevarria and the government, nor did she attempt to suggest that she possessed evidence to show that Echevarria had been involved in the 1991 conspiracy.  Instead, counsel concentrated on eliciting the exact terms of Echevarria's agreement with the government and wholly abandoned any attempt to ask about his alleged involvement in his wife's crime.  In response to defense counsel's questions, Echevarria acknowledged that he had been paid $10,800 in cash for his cooperation in the case and further admitted that he hoped his cooperation would inure to the benefit of his wife who had been convicted of a drug-related crime and was awaiting sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by limiting defense counsel's cross-examination of Echevarria.  More specifically, defendant claims that the district court's evidentiary ruling prevented his attorney from fully exposing Echevarria's motive to testify, and from impeaching Echevarria on the collateral issue of his involvement in his wife's 1991 drug activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine witnesses against him or her is \"fundamental and demanding of great respect,\"  United States v. Twomey, 806 F.2d 1136, 1139 (1st Cir. 1986).  This right, however, is not without limits.  \" 'On the contrary, trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on ... cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.' \"   United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1009-10 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting  Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986)).  On appeal, we review a trial court's limitations upon cross-examination under an abuse of discretion standard.   See Twomey, 806 F.2d at 1140.  \"In order to establish that the trial judge abused his discretion in limiting cross-examination, the defendant must show that the restriction imposed were clearly prejudicial.\"  Id. Defendant makes no such showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the record reveals that Echevarria's motives for testifying were fully disclosed.  As noted above, during cross-examination of Echevarria, defense counsel unearthed the exact terms of the agreement between Echevarria and the government.  Thus, the jury was afforded sufficient information to make a discriminating appraisal of Echevarria's motives and bias.  See id.;  United States v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1992).  In the absence of any evidence to suggest that there were additional agreements made between Echevarria and the government, we disagree with defendant's assertion that he was denied an opportunity to fully expose Echevarria's motivation to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's argument that the district court improperly limited cross-examination regarding Echevarria's involvement in the 1991 drug conspiracy is equally unpersuasive.  Trial judges may \"limit impeachment evidence on matters that are deemed collateral or irrelevant.\"   United States v. Walker, 930 F.2d 789, 791-92 (10th Cir. 1991);  see also United States v. Moore, 923 U.S. 910, 913 (1st Cir. 1991) (stating that the district court \"has broad discretionary authority to prohibit cross-examination where that cross-examination would introduce into the case collateral matters that could confuse the jury, that would require later introduction of otherwise unnecessary, additional, potentially clarifying evidence, or that might prejudice one of the parties\").  As the trial court aptly noted, the only evidence remotely suggesting that Echevarria had been involved in the 1991 conspiracy was his 1991 unprosecuted arrest.  Yet, charges from this arrest were dismissed for lack of probable cause.  Moreover, defendant failed below, and has failed on appeal, to proffer any additional evidence of Echevarria's involvement in the 1991 conspiracy.  Without such a proffer, the district court acted well within its discretion to hold that defendant was bound by Echevarria's proclamation of \"innocence,\" and could not further question Echevarria about this collateral matter without demonstrating a good faith basis for the inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant appears to argue, albeit in a perfunctory manner, that, under Fed.  R. Evid. 608(b), evidence of Echevarria's prior drug involvement should not have been excluded because it was relevant to Echevarria's character for truthfulness.  We need not delay long on this complaint.  As we noted in  Pinkham v. Maine Cent. R.R. Co., 874 F.2d 875, 879 (1st Cir. 1989) (collecting cases), evidence of a witness's drug involvement is generally not admissible for character impeachment purposes.  Accordingly, we see no error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record before us provides no further elaboration on the grounds for dismissal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500 et seq.;   Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Defendant alternatively argues that, under Fed.  R. Evid. 404(b), the evidence of prior drug involvement should not have been excluded.  Without reaching defendant's dubious and unsupported assertion that Fed.  R. Evid. 404(b) is relevant to a discussion of impeachment of a government witness, we note that \"other act\" evidence \"must have some 'special relevance' to a material issue such as motive, opportunity, intent,preparation, plan, or knowledge.\"   Carty, 993 F.2d at 1011 (emphasis supplied).  Admission of other act evidence under Fed.  R. Evid. 404(b) \"is committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we review its ruling only for abuse of discretion.\"  Id. Not only has defendant failed to demonstrate a good faith basis for questioning Echevarria about prior drug involvement, he has not shown that this nonexistent evidence bears some special relevance to a material issue in the case</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

On appeal, we review a trial court's limitations upon cross-examination under an abuse of discretion standard.   See Twomey, 806 F.2d at 1140.  \"In order to establish that the trial judge abused his discretion in limiting cross-examination, the defendant must show that the restriction imposed were clearly prejudicial.\"  Id. Defendant makes no such showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the record reveals that Echevarria's motives for testifying were fully disclosed.  As noted above, during cross-examination of Echevarria, defense counsel unearthed the exact terms of the agreement between Echevarria and the government.  Thus, the jury was afforded sufficient information to make a discriminating appraisal of Echevarria's motives and bias.  See id.;  United States v. McLaughlin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578198\"><a href=\"/opinion/578198/united-states-v-bernard-michael-mclaughlin-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1992).  In the absence of any evidence to suggest that there were additional agreements made between Echevarria and the government, we disagree with defendant's assertion that he was denied an opportunity to fully expose Echevarria's motivation to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's argument that the district court improperly limited cross-examination regarding Echevarria's involvement in the 1991 drug conspiracy is equally unpersuasive.  Trial judges may \"limit impeachment evidence on matters that are deemed collateral or irrelevant.\"   United States v. Walker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559060\"><a href=\"/opinion/559060/united-states-v-bobby-kent-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span>, 791-92 (10th Cir. 1991);  see also United States v. Moore, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></span>, 913 (1st Cir. 1991) (stating that the district court \"has broad discretionary authority to prohibit cross-examination where that cross-examination would introduce into the case collateral matters that could confuse the jury, that would require later introduction of otherwise unnecessary, additional, potentially clarifying evidence, or that might prejudice one of the parties\").  As the trial court aptly noted, the only evidence remotely suggesting that Echevarria had been involved in the 1991 conspiracy was his 1991 unprosecuted arrest.  Yet, charges from this arrest were dismissed for lack of probable cause.  Moreover, defendant failed below, and has failed on appeal, to proffer any additional evidence of Echevarria's involvement in the 1991 conspiracy.  Without such a proffer, the district court acted well within its discretion to hold that defendant was bound by Echevarria's proclamation of \"innocence,\" and could not further question Echevarria about this collateral matter without demonstrating a good faith basis for the inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant appears to argue, albeit in a perfunctory manner, that, under Fed.  R. Evid. 608(b), evidence of Echevarria's prior drug involvement should not have been excluded because it was relevant to Echevarria's character for truthfulness.  We need not delay long on this complaint.  As we noted in  Pinkham v. Maine Cent. R.R. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523148\"><a href=\"/opinion/523148/edward-e-pinkham-v-maine-central-railroad-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span>, 879 (1st Cir. 1989) (collecting cases), evidence of a witness's drug involvement is generally not admissible for character impeachment purposes.  Accordingly, we see no error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record before us provides no further elaboration on the grounds for dismissal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500 et seq.;   Jencks v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105517\"><a href=\"/opinion/105517/jencks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span> (1957)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Defendant alternatively argues that, under Fed.  R. Evid. 404(b), the evidence of prior drug involvement should not have been excluded.  Without reaching defendant's dubious and unsupported assertion that Fed.  R. Evid. 404(b) is relevant to a discussion of impeachment of a government witness, we note that \"other act\" evidence \"must have some 'special relevance' to a material issue such as motive, opportunity, intent,preparation, plan, or knowledge.\"   Carty, 993 F.2d at 1011 (emphasis supplied).  Admission of other act evidence under Fed.  R. Evid. 404(b) \"is committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we review its ruling only for abuse of discretion.\"  Id. Not only has defendant failed to demonstrate a good faith basis for questioning Echevarria about prior drug involvement, he has not shown that this nonexistent evidence bears some special relevance to a material issue in the case</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
