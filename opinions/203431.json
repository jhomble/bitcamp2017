Hahn and Hahn & Matkov on brief for petitioner.\n     Kathleen J. Kelly, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, Jeffrey S. Bucholtz, Acting Assistant Attorney General,\nCivil Division, and Mary Jane Candaux, Assistant Director, U.S.\nDepartment of Justice, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief\nfor respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                          August 8, 2008\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.      Omega H. Sinurat, a native and\n\ncitizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of a decision by the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying his application for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (\"CAT\").      We deny the petition.\n\n            Sinurat entered the United States on April 25, 2003 using\n\na passport that he obtained under an assumed name.        He applied for\n\nasylum on July 2, 2004.         The Department of Homeland Security\n\n(\"DHS\") issued a Notice to Appear to Sinurat on September 9, 2004,\n\ncharging him as removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) as\n\nan alien not in possession of a valid entry document as required by\n\nthe    Immigration   and   Nationality   Act.   Sinurat   conceded   his\n\nremovability, but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the CAT. A hearing was held before an Immigration\n\nJudge (\"IJ\") on December 6, 2005.\n\n            Sinurat testified that he is a Christian Protestant and\n\nwas persecuted in Indonesia on the basis of religion.          In 1992,\n\nmore than ten years before he entered the United States, he was\n\nbeaten by three students from a rival, predominantly Muslim high\n\nschool.   Sinurat testified they targeted him because he attended a\n\npredominantly Christian school.     Although he reported the incident\n\nto local police, the police took no action.           Sinurat was not\n\nhospitalized for his injuries, and he returned to school the next\n\nday.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          Sinurat also described a second incident in 1992 in which\n\nstudents from the rival Muslim high school stabbed his friend in\n\nthe back with a knife.     Although his friend was taken to the\n\nhospital, the police again did not take action.    Sinurat testified\n\nthat he feared returning to Indonesia because of these incidents\n\nand because of a series of church bomb threats in 2000, including\n\nan attack on his family's church.       He and his family feared\n\nattending church because of these threats.        After high school,\n\nSinurat attended a Catholic college for five years in Indonesia\n\nwithout experiencing any threats to his safety.1     The rest of his\n\nfamily remains in Indonesia today.\n\n          Sinurat further testified that he tried to obtain a visa\n\nin his own name, but after being rejected three times, he obtained\n\na visa under a false name, Dotte Damawan, in February 2001.       He\n\nleft for the United States in April 2003.   Sinurat testified that\n\nhe waited to leave Indonesia because he was working and saving\n\nmoney to come to the United States, and because he was waiting for\n\npermission from his parents to leave.\n\n          The IJ rejected Sinurat's claims for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under the CAT, and found him removable\n\nas charged.   Although he found Sinurat credible, the IJ found that\n\n\n     1\n      Although Sinurat testified that his family was attacked once,\nand alluded to \"incidents . . . in 1998,\" he never elaborated on\nthese events elsewhere in the record, and the IJ found that any\nallegations were \"merely anecdotal, unsubstantiated, and unreliable\ntestimony.\"\n\n                                -3-\n\fit was unclear whether Sinurat had been targeted in 1992 because of\n\nhis religion or because he was a student at a rival high school.\n\nRegardless, the IJ determined that the harm Sinurat experienced\n\nonly amounted to \"sporadic private discrimination\" and that there\n\nwas no evidence that such discrimination was \"sponsored, supported,\n\nor condoned by the government.\"     Moreover, the IJ concluded that\n\nsuch sporadic discrimination could not give Sinurat an objectively\n\nreasonable fear of future persecution because Sinurat had not\n\nsuffered problems while attending college in Indonesia, and because\n\nhe delayed his departure for two years after receiving a visa.\n\nFurther, the IJ emphasized that Sinurat's family continued to live\n\nunharmed in Indonesia, and Sinurat had not provided evidence of\n\nthreats against them.   The IJ granted Sinurat voluntary departure.\n\n           Sinurat appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA on January\n\n3, 2006.   The BIA dismissed Sinurat's appeal on July 10, 2007.   The\n\nBIA agreed with the IJ's opinion, finding no clear factual error in\n\nthe IJ's determination that Sinurat's high school incident did not\n\nrise to the level of persecution.     The BIA agreed with the IJ that\n\neven if Sinurat could establish a genuine fear of persecution, his\n\nfear was not objectively reasonable.      The BIA further concluded\n\nthat Sinurat had also failed to satisfy the higher standard for\n\nwithholding of removal and that he had failed to provide any\n\nevidence that he would be subjected to torture if returned to\n\nIndonesia.    Sinurat timely petitioned this court for review.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f             We    review    the    BIA's     factual    findings    under     the\n\ndeferential substantial evidence standard.              Kechichian v. Mukasey,\n\nNo.    07-1584, ___ F.3d. ___, 2008 WL 2814789, at *3 (1st Cir. July\n\n23, 2008).        \"When the BIA adopts the IJ's opinion and discusses\n\nsome of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we have authority to review\n\nboth the IJ's and the BIA's opinions.\"            Ouk v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d\n\n108, 110 (1st Cir. 2006).          We uphold the BIA's findings if they are\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\"            Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d\n\n467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                 We reverse\n\nonly if \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude\n\nto    the   contrary.\"   8   U.S.C.    §    1252(b)(4)(B);   see    also,    e.g.,\n\nChikkeur v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 1381, 1382-83 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n             To qualify for asylum, Sinurat bears the burden of\n\nproving that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution based on his religion.                  See Chikkeur,\n\n514 F.3d at 1382.           To qualify as persecution, the harm to the\n\npetitioner must exceed \"unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic\n\nsuffering.\"        Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nSubstantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that the\n\nharms Sinurat suffered in Indonesia did not constitute persecution.\n\n             Sinurat claims that de novo review is required because\n\nthe IJ stated that it was \"unclear\" whether the students attacked\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fSinurat because he was a Christian or because of the schools'\n\nrivalry, rather than making an explicit finding. This argument has\n\nno merit.     See Pulisir v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d                  302, 310 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (\"[It] does [not] matter that the BIA and IJ did not dissect\n\nevery scrap of proof.\").            Both the IJ and the BIA concluded that\n\nregardless of the students' motives, the harm Sinurat experienced\n\nin this one-time incident did not amount to past persecution.\n\n            Sinurat also argues, with regard to his claim of future\n\npersecution, that the IJ erred by relying on the more positive\n\nsections of the State Department reports, which were less favorable\n\nto his case, instead of relying on the sections describing a more\n\nnegative outlook for Indonesian Christians.                The IJ's assessment of\n\nthe reports was not unreasonable. See Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80,\n\n87 n.6 (1st Cir. 2007) (deferring to the IJ's \"reasonable\" choice\n\nto rely on an \"unfavorable passage\" from a State Department report\n\nover a passage \"more favorable\" to the petitioner); see also\n\nSipayung v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"We cannot\n\nsay   the   IJ's    reading     of    the        State   Department   reports    was\n\nunreasonable,      especially    in    light       of    the   experience   of   [the\n\npetitioner's]      family,    all     of    whom     practiced    Christianity    in\n\nIndonesia without persecution.\").\n\n            Sinurat also argues that the IJ erred by finding that\n\nSinurat had not shown that the Indonesian government actively\n\ndiscriminates against and persecutes Christians.                      The IJ, and\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fultimately the BIA, reasonably found no connection between the\n\nIndonesian government's treatment of Christians generally and the\n\nisolated attack on Sinurat.           See Kho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 54\n\n(1st   Cir.     2007)     (\"We   have    repeatedly   affirmed       the    BIA's\n\ndeterminations .      .   .   that there is no ongoing pattern or practice\n\nof persecution against . . . Christians in Indonesia.\"); see also\n\nSombah v. Mukasey, 529 F.3d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"Discrimination\n\nin Indonesia does not, without more, qualify a Christian Indonesian\n\nnational for asylum.\").\n\n              The BIA also correctly found that Sinurat failed to\n\nsatisfy the requirements for withholding of removal.                       If the\n\napplicant cannot meet the lower burden of proof for establishing his\n\neligibility     for   asylum,    he   therefore   cannot   satisfy    the    more\n\nstringent standard for withholding of removal.               See Makhoul v.\n\nAshcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              Lastly, because Sinurat does not make any arguments in\n\neither his petition or his brief before the BIA regarding relief\n\nunder the CAT, that claim is waived.          See Sombah, 529 F.3d at 52;\n\nZeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 66 n.4 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n              We deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f",

He and his family feared attending church because of these threats. After high school, Sinurat attended a Catholic college for five years in Indonesia without experiencing any threats to his safety.<sup>[1]</sup> The rest of his family remains in Indonesia today.</p>\n<p>Sinurat further testified that he tried to obtain a visa in his own name, but after being rejected three times, he obtained a visa under a false name, Dotte Damawan, in February 2001. He left for the United States in April 2003. Sinurat testified that he waited to leave Indonesia because he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> was working and saving money to come to the United States, and because he was waiting for permission from his parents to leave.</p>\n<p>The IJ rejected Sinurat's claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT, and found him removable as charged. Although he found Sinurat credible, the IJ found that it was unclear whether Sinurat had been targeted in 1992 because of his religion or because he was a student at a rival high school. Regardless, the IJ determined that the harm Sinurat experienced only amounted to \"sporadic private discrimination\" and that there was no evidence that such discrimination was \"sponsored, supported, or condoned by the government.\" Moreover, the IJ concluded that such sporadic discrimination could not give Sinurat an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution because Sinurat had not suffered problems while attending college in Indonesia, and because he delayed his departure for two years after receiving a visa. Further, the IJ emphasized that Sinurat's family continued to live unharmed in Indonesia, and Sinurat had not provided evidence of threats against them. The IJ granted Sinurat voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>Sinurat appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA on January 3, 2006. The BIA dismissed Sinurat's appeal on July 10, 2007. The BIA agreed with the IJ's opinion, finding no clear factual error in the IJ's determination that Sinurat's high school incident did not rise to the level of persecution. The BIA agreed with the IJ that even if Sinurat could establish a genuine fear of persecution, his fear was not objectively reasonable. The BIA further concluded that Sinurat had also failed to satisfy the higher standard for withholding of removal and that he had failed to provide any evidence that he would be subjected to torture if returned to Indonesia. Sinurat timely petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p>We review the BIA's factual findings under the deferential substantial evidence standard. <i>Kechichian v.

Substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that the harms Sinurat suffered in Indonesia did not constitute persecution.</p>\n<p>Sinurat claims that de novo review is required because the IJ stated that it was \"unclear\" whether the students attacked Sinurat because he was a Christian or because of the schools' rivalry, rather than making an explicit finding. This argument has no merit. <i>See </i><i>Pulisir v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203272\"><a href=\"/opinion/203272/pulisir-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 310 (1st Cir.2008) (\"[It] does [not] matter that the BIA and IJ did not dissect every scrap of proof.\"). Both the IJ and the BIA concluded that regardless of the students' motives, the harm Sinurat experienced in this one-time incident did not amount to past persecution.</p>\n<p>Sinurat also argues, with regard to his claim of future persecution, that the IJ erred by relying on the more positive sections of the State Department reports, which were less favorable to his case, instead of relying on the sections describing a more negative outlook for Indonesian Christians. The IJ's assessment of the reports was not unreasonable. <i>See </i><i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 87 n. 6 (1st Cir. 2007) (deferring to the IJ's \"reasonable\" choice to rely on an \"unfavorable passage\" from a State Department report over a passage \"more favorable\" to the petitioner); <i>see also </i><i>Sipayung v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202816\"><a href=\"/opinion/202816/sipayung-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2007) (\"We cannot say the IJ's reading of the State Department reports was unreasonable, especially in light of the experience of [the petitioner's] family, all of whom practiced Christianity in Indonesia without persecution.\").</p>\n<p>Sinurat also argues that the IJ erred by finding that Sinurat had not shown that the Indonesian government actively discriminates against and persecutes Christians. The IJ, and ultimately the BIA, reasonably found no connection between the Indonesian government's treatment of Christians generally and the isolated attack on Sinurat. <i>See </i><i>Kho v. Keisler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202978\"><a href=\"/opinion/202978/kho-v-keisler/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2007) (\"We have repeatedly affirmed the BIA's determinations... that there is no ongoing pattern or practice of persecution against ... Christians in Indonesia.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Sombah v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203336\"><a href=\"/opinion/203336/sombah-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"Discrimination in Indonesia does not, without more, qualify a Christian Indonesian national for asylum.\").</p>\n<p>The BIA also correctly found that Sinurat failed to satisfy the requirements for withholding of removal. If the applicant cannot meet the lower burden of proof for establishing his eligibility for asylum, he therefore cannot satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <i>See </i><i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Lastly, because Sinurat does not make any arguments in either his petition or his brief before the BIA regarding relief under the CAT, that claim is waived. <i>See </i><i>Sombah,</i> 529 F.3d at 52; <i>Zeru v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span>, 66 n. 4 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>We <i>deny</i> the petition for review.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although Sinurat testified that his family was attacked once, and alluded to \"incidents... in 1998,\" he never elaborated on these events elsewhere in the record, and the IJ found that any allegations were \"merely anecdotal, unsubstantiated, and unreliable testimony.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
