Three months  later, the district  court recon-\n\nsidered the original sentence sua sponte and imposed a twenty-one\n                                        \n\nmonth  prison term.   We  deny  Fahm's appeal  from the  original\n\nsentence and conclude that the district court  was without juris-\n\ndiction to \"correct\" it under Fed. R. Crim.

See\n                                                                 \n\n18 U.S.C.     1029(a)(2) (fraudulent  use of  unauthorized access\n\ndevices) and (b)(2)  (conspiracy to violate   1029(a)(2)).   Fahm\n\nwas twenty-one years  of age at  the time.   Less than one  month\n\nlater, while  released pending  sentencing, he  was arrested  for\n\nobstructing a  Rhode Island police  officer in connection  with a\n\nmotor  vehicle violation, whereupon he  fled, failed to report to\n\nhis pretrial  services officer,  and violated  bail by  absenting\n\nhimself from the federal sentencing hearing scheduled for January\n\n1991.  Shortly thereafter  Fahm committed the crime  of attempted\n\ncredit card  fraud, for which  he was convicted and  sentenced in\n\nthe United  States District Court  for the District  of Delaware.\n\n                                2\n\nAfter serving  a five-month sentence  on the latter  charge, Fahm\n\nwas returned  to the District  of Rhode Island for  sentencing on\n\nthe offenses of conviction.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.

Royer,  895 F.2d 28,  29 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1990),  by denying him a two-level reduction for \"acceptance\n\nof responsibility\" pursuant to  U.S.S.G.   3E1.1(a) (Nov.  1990).\n\nWe find it  quite unremarkable that Fahm's  belated protestations\n\nof remorse fell on  deaf ears in  the district court (\"I  frankly\n\ndon't believe  . . . that [the defendant is]  sorry. . . .).

Ignoring the overburden,  Fahm argues that no\n\nunusual circumstances distinguish his case from the \"mine-run for\n\nth[e]  offense[s]\" of conviction.  United States v. Aguilar-Pena,\n                                                                \n\n887 F.2d 347, 350 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          a.   The Decision to Depart.\n                                     \n\n          The  original  presentence report  (PSR)  recommended a\n\nsix-to-twelve month guideline sentencing range (GSR), based on an\n\nadjusted base offense level (ABOL) of ten and a level  I criminal\n\nhistory category (CHC).   The PSR addendum prepared  prior to the\n\nsentencing hearing held on  September 30, 1992 (\"first hearing\"),\n\nproposed a level II CHC based on Fahm's intervening Delaware sen-\n\ntence.  See U.S.S.G.    4A1.2 cmt. 1.  At the  first hearing, the\n           \n\ndistrict court advised Fahm that it intended to depart to CHC IV,\n\nbecause (i)  Fahm committed the  Delaware offense while  on bail,\n\nsee id.  at   4A1.3; United  States v.  Calderon, 935 F.2d  9, 12\n                                                \n\n(1st  Cir. 1991) (commission  of offense while  on release repre-\n\nsents  breach  of  commitment to  court),  (ii)  CHC  II underre-\n\n                    \n\n     1The revised presentence report recommended criminal history\ncategory II, based  on Fahm's similar Rhode Island  state convic-\ntion for fraudulent use of  credit cards and his \"prior sentence\"\non the federal credit-fraud offense in Delaware.  See U.S.S.G.   \n                                                     \n4A1.1(b), 4A1.2(a)(1),(4), cmt. 1.\n\n                                4\n\npresented his actual criminal conduct, and (iii) the CHC would be\n\nhigher  were any  of  several pending  state and  federal charges\n\nlater  to result in  conviction, see U.S.S.G.    4A1.3(e); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Figaro, 935 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir. 1991).2\n                \n\n          The decision to depart is subject to bifurcated review.\n\nFirst,  all  \"quintessentially  legal\"   rulings  underlying  the\n\ndecision  to depart,  such  as  whether  the  guideline  language\n\npermits or forbids  departure for the kinds of  reasons relied on\n                                                       \n\nby the sentencing  court, are subject to plenary  review.

Dec. 9, 1993).\n\n                    \n\n     2Fahm  does not argue that the original sentence contravened\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.3, which instructs the sentencing court to consid-\ner  the adequacy of  the next higher (or  lower) CHC, rather than\nleapfrogging.  See United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 70 (1st\n                                           \nCir. 1991)  (noting that  sentencing court  is \"specifically  in-\nstructed  to use  'as  a  reference, the  guideline  range for  a\ndefendant with a  higher or lower  criminal history category,  as\napplicable'\"  (quoting U.S.S.G.   4A1.3, p.s.)); United States v.\n                                                              \nPolanco-Reynoso,  924 F.2d 23,  25 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (approving  \n               \n4A1.3 departure to next CHC).   Since Fahm's one oblique allusion\nto the leapfrogging methodology  appears in a parenthetical to  a\ncase citation, unaccompanied  by argumentation, we adhere  to our\nsettled rule that  \"issues adverted to  in a perfunctory  manner,\nunaccompanied  by  some effort  at  developed argumentation,  are\ndeemed waived.\"   United States v.

There was no clear\nerror in the factual findings underlying the decision to depart.\n\n                                7\n\ninvolving  \"the same sort  of dishonesty and  misappropriation of\n\nother  people's property\"  are \"similar\").    Thus, the  district\n\ncourt reasonably  concluded that  CHC II  underrepresented Fahm's\n\nactual criminal history, a finding well supported, inter alia, by\n                                                             \n\nthe similar  credit-fraud  related charges  committed within  two\n\nyears of the  instant offenses, evidencing  a serious pattern  of\n\nrecidivism  not  reflected in  the  conventional CHC  calculation\n\nunder  U.S.S.G.    4A1.1 and  4A1.2.

[n]o more  is exigible.\"), we  note that the  reason-\nableness of the district court's decision  to depart to CHC IV is\nstrongly supported by the unadjudicated state and federal charges\npending  against  Fahm,  and by  analogous  criminal  conduct not\nreflected in the original CHC  calculation.  There are two felony\ncharges  pending against Fahm in Massachusetts, dating from 1988,\nfor larceny  of an automobile and obtaining  property under false\npretenses, see Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266    27A(a), 30, 34.  Further,\n              \nafter Fahm defaulted on these two charges, a warrant issued; this\ndefault conduct is  analogous to a federal charge  of flight from\nprosecution, see 18 U.S.C.   1073(1); see also Aymelek,  926 F.2d\n                                                      \nat 71 (federal law governs classification of criminal conduct for\nguideline  sentencing purposes).   Moreover,  there  is a  felony\ncharge  outstanding  against  Fahm  for  violating  Rhode  Island\nbanking laws in 1990, see R.I. Gen. L.   19-19-2 (issuing fraudu-\n                         \nlent  check),  and another  1990  Rhode Island  state  charge for\nobstructing a police officer with  the use of an alias,  see R.I.\n                                                            \nGen. L.   11-32-1 (up to one year in prison), see also Moore, 931\n                                                            \nF.2d at 5 n.3 (minor  convictions, in aggregate, can show pattern\nof conduct supporting finding of recidivism).\n     Yet pending as  well is a federal felony  charge for failure\nto  appear at  the sentencing  hearing  originally scheduled  for\nJanuary, 1991.   See  18 U.S.C.   3146(a)(1).   Finally,  the CHC\n                    \ncalculation in  the PSR did  not reflect that Fahm  committed the\n\n                                9\n\n          The grave signs of recidivism relied on by the district\n\ncourt  likewise weighed heavily in favor  of a substantial upward\n\ndeparture  as well.5   The pending Massachusetts  false pretenses\n\nand larceny  charges  and the  Rhode  Island banking  law  charge\n\ninvolved alleged conduct similar to the instant credit card fraud\n\noffense, and Fahm's flight to avoid prosecution in this case is a\n\ncarbon copy of his  uncharged conduct of failing to answer to the\n\nMassachusetts charges following release pending prosecution.  See\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.3(e), p.s.   The Rhode Island  obstruction charge,\n\nbased  on Fahm's  alleged use  of an  alias to  mislead a  police\n\n                    \n\noffenses  of conviction after  having defaulted (i.e.,  failed to\n                                                     \nappear) on  the Massachusetts  charges, which  would warrant  two\nadditional CH points.  See U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(d) (add two points if\n                          \ninstant offense committed while on bail).\n     These pending state  and federal charges, combined  with the\ntwo-point   4A1.1(d) increase and the  analogous uncharged crimi-\nnal  conduct, would aggregate eight additional criminal points at\na minimum.   Ascribing  even a single  criminal history  point to\neach pending state charge, and one to the pending federal charge,\nwould result  in five  points.   See U.S.S.G.    4A1.1(a),(b),(c)\n                                    \n(assigning, respectively,  three points for sentence  above thir-\nteen months, two points for sentences between  three and thirteen\nmonths, and  one point  for under three  months).   Neither these\npending  charges,  nor  the analogous  conduct  (amounting  to an\nadditional one  point),  nor the  two-point   4A1.1(d)  increase,\nwere taken into  account in the  CHC calculation, which  totalled\nthree  criminal history  points.   Thus, at  its lowest  range (8\npoints), the pending  charges, analogous conduct, and  the   4A1-\n.1(d) increase,  combined with  the three  points originally  as-\nsigned, would indicate  a level V CHC.   See U.S.S.G.   5A  (sen-\n                                            \ntencing table).\n\n     5At the first hearing, the district court found:\n\n     You haven't  spent much  time in jail  in spite  of the\n     number of  brushes you've had  with the law,  and maybe\n     that's the  problem . . .  but at age  [21] . . .  it's\n     about time . . .  for you to accept  responsibility for\n     what you  did and  pay the penalty  . . .

These  charges and  the\n\nuncharged analogous conduct all involved criminal activity within\n\ntwo years of the offenses of conviction.  See U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(e)\n                                             \n\n(two-point  criminal  history  increase  to  reflect  recency  of\n\noffense); Figaro, 935  F.2d at 7 (treating recency  of offense as\n                \n\nevidence  of recidivism) (  4A1.3 departure).  The district court\n\nfurther found that  Fahm had been treated leniently  in the past,\n\nand had persisted    before  and since the offenses of conviction\n\n   in the same pattern of credit fraud.\n\n          Given  Fahm's  significantly  underrepresented criminal\n\nhistory and his serious  recidivism, as evidenced by  the recency\n\nof his criminal  conduct and his commission of  criminal offenses\n\nwhile  released awaiting prosecution on other charges, the degree\n\nof the departure  imposed by the  district court was  reasonable.\n\nSee generally United States v.

At the  second sentencing\n\nhearing, on December 22, the district court declined to reconsid-\n\ner its   4A1.3 departure  ruling, then indicated that it intended\n\nto correct an earlier oversight  by increasing Fahm's ABOL by two\n\nlevels for  unlawful flight  from prosecution.   Defense  counsel\n\nobjected that the  court lacked jurisdiction to  reconsider under\n\nFed. R. Crim.  P. 35 but made no explicit reference to the seven-\n\nday limitation period in Rule 35(c).  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c);\n                                         \n\ninfra at  p. 15.   The court  then increased the  original prison\n     \n\nsentence to twenty-one months, bringing it within the revised 21-\n\nto-27 month GSR.\n\n          On appeal, Fahm  claims that the district  court lacked\n\njurisdiction  to  increase  the sentence  originally  imposed  on\n\nSeptember 30.  See Fed.  R. Crim. P. 35(c).   The government,  on\n                  \n\nthe other hand,  characterizes the December 22 hearing  as a mere\n\ncontinuation  of the first hearing, and accordingly contends that\n\nthe seven-day limitation period in Rule 35(c) was not implicated.\n\nAlternatively,  the  government  argues that  the  district court\n\npossessed  inherent power  to  reconsider  the original  sentence\n\nnotwithstanding the limitation period in Rule 35(c).  We conclude\n\nthat neither government theory is tenable.\n\n                                12\n\n     1.   Fed. R. Crim.

Moreover, the September 30 hearing transcript reflects\n\nthat  the court pronounced the original sentence after overruling\n                                                                 \n\nFahm's objection to the   4A1.3 departure.

Although the\n\ncourt categorically  denied a  stay     leaving its  twenty-month\n\nsentence in  place    it  allowed defense counsel time  to submit\n\nwritten opposition.   The district  court record thus  belies any\n\ninterpretation  that sentence  was  not imposed  on September 30.\n\nConsequently,  we must decide  whether the original  sentence was\n\nsubject  to reconsideration by the district court on December 22,\n\nwell beyond the time allowed under Rule 35(c).\n\n          Rule 35(c) states:\n\n          (c)   Correction  of  Sentence by  Sentencing\n          Court.

Three months later, the district court reconsidered the original sentence sua sponte and imposed a twenty-one month prison term.  We deny Fahm's appeal from the original sentence and conclude that the district court was without jurisdiction to \"correct\" it under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fahm pled guilty in Rhode Island federal district court on November 29, 1990, to credit card fraud and conspiracy.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1029(a)(2) (fraudulent use of unauthorized access devices) and (b)(2) (conspiracy to violate Sec. 1029(a)(2)).  Fahm was twenty-one years of age at the time.  Less than one month later, while released pending sentencing, he was arrested for obstructing a Rhode Island police officer in connection with a motor vehicle violation, whereupon he fled, failed to report to his pretrial services officer, and violated bail by absenting himself from the federal sentencing hearing scheduled for January 1991.  Shortly thereafter Fahm committed the crime of attempted credit card fraud, for which he was convicted and sentenced in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  After serving a five-month sentence on the latter charge, Fahm was returned to the District of Rhode Island for sentencing on the offenses of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>A.

Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir.1990), by denying him a two-level reduction for \"acceptance of responsibility\" pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1(a) (Nov.1990).  We find it quite unremarkable that Fahm's belated protestations of remorse fell on deaf ears in the district court (\"I frankly don't believe ... that [the defendant is] sorry....).  See United States v. O'Neil, 936 F.2d 599, 600 (1st Cir.1991) (district court may look to later conduct to determine sincerity of defendant's claimed acceptance of responsibility).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Sec. 4A1.3,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> which provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>If reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)   Ignoring the overburden, Fahm argues that no unusual circumstances distinguish his case from the \"mine-run for th[e] offense[s]\" of conviction.  United States v. Aguilar-Pena, 887 F.2d 347, 350 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. The Decision to Depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original presentence report (PSR) recommended a six-to-twelve month guideline sentencing range (GSR), based on an adjusted base offense level (ABOL) of ten and a level I criminal history category (CHC).  The PSR addendum prepared prior to the sentencing hearing held on September 30, 1992 (\"first hearing\"), proposed a level II CHC based on Fahm's intervening Delaware sentence.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2 cmt. 1.  At the first hearing, the district court advised Fahm that it intended to depart to CHC IV, because (i) Fahm committed the Delaware offense while on bail, see id. at Sec. 4A1.3;  United States v. Calderon, 935 F.2d 9, 12 (1st Cir.1991) (commission of offense while on release represents breach of commitment to court), (ii) CHC II underrepresented his actual criminal conduct, and (iii) the CHC would be higher were any of several pending state and federal charges later to result in conviction, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3(e);  United States v. Figaro, 935 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir.1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to depart is subject to bifurcated review.  First, all \"quintessentially legal\" rulings underlying the decision to depart, such as whether the guideline language permits or forbids departure for the kinds of reasons relied on by the sentencing court, are subject to plenary review.  United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 951 (1st Cir.1993).  Second, in reviewing its \"judgment call\" as to whether the particular circumstances warrant departure, id. at 951-52, \"appropriate respect\" is due the sentencing court's \"superior 'feel' for the ... case.\"  United States v. Ramirez, 11 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Legal Rationale for Departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guidelines explicitly countenance upward departures pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3, based on the rationale adopted by the district court in this case:  \"[T]he criminal history score is unlikely to take into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history that may occur.... particularly ... in the case of younger defendants (e.g., defendants in their early twenties or younger) who are more likely to have received repeated lenient treatment, yet who may actually pose a greater risk of serious recidivism than older defendants.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3, backg'd.  (emphasis added).  Given Fahm's youth, the similarity and contemporaneity of his criminal conduct, and the fact that he had but one countable \"prior sentence,\" see U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.2 cmt. 1, the district court correctly determined that departure was permissible pursuant to Sec. 4A1.3(d), (e), provided reliable information demonstrated that CHC II significantly underrepresented the seriousness of Fahm's actual criminal history and the risk of recidivism.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Factual Grounds for Departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were we called upon to do so, we would review the sentencing court's findings of fact for clear error, Rivera, 994 F.2d at 950, but Fahm challenges neither the reliability of the criminal history evidence nor the factual findings on which the departure decision was based.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can we fault the district court's \"judgment call,\" see United States v. DiazVillafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49-50 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862, 110 S.Ct. 177, 107 L.Ed.2d 133 (1989), that Fahm's criminal history warranted an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3(d), (e), a ruling we review with the considerable deference due the sentencing court's \"special competence\" and superior \"feel\" in the circumstances of the particular case, Ramirez, 11 F.3d at 13;  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 951-52.   In far less egregious circumstances we have sustained an upward departure where the offenses of conviction were committed while the defendant was awaiting final disposition of similar state charge.  See Calderon, 935 F.2d at 12.   Fahm committed these offenses while awaiting disposition of similar Massachusetts charges (larceny of an automobile and obtaining property under false pretenses) which had yet to result in conviction.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3(e).  Furthermore, while awaiting sentencing on the instant offenses, he committed a similar credit-fraud felony in Delaware.  See United States v. Moore, 931 F.2d 3, 4 (1st Cir.1991) (offenses involving \"the same sort of dishonesty and misappropriation of other people's property\" are \"similar\" ).  Thus, the district court reasonably concluded that CHC II under-represented Fahm's actual criminal history, a finding well supported, inter alia, by the similar credit-fraud related charges committed within two years of the instant offenses, evidencing a serious pattern of recidivism not reflected in the conventional CHC calculation under U.S.S.G. Secs. 4A1.1 and 4A1.2.  See Figaro, 935 F.2d at 7 (\"the recency of a prior offense may be considered an indicator of increased likelihood of recidivism, exacerbating the seriousness of a defendant's criminal history.\");  United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 70 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The Degree of Departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonableness of the degree of departure is reviewed with \"appropriate respect\" for the sentencing court's \"special competence,\" Rivera, 994 F.2d at 952, and substantial deference to its weighting of departure factors properly considered under the guidelines.  See Williams v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1121, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The criminal conduct alleged in the four cases pending against Fahm in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, as well as the federal charge pending in the District of Rhode Island, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3146(a)(1) (failure to appear for sentencing), which were not reflected in the CHC calculation, constituted grounds which, by analogy, see Aymelek, 926 F.2d at 70 (using analogies for Sec. 4A1.3(e) departures), plainly indicated that neither CHC II nor III adequately reflected the seriousness of Fahm's criminal conduct.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3(e) (\"prior,\" \"similar\" criminal conduct not yet resulting in conviction appropriate for consideration in departure decision);  Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 50 (pending charges not used in CHC calculation may be considered in departure decision);  United States v. Brown, 899 F.2d 94, 98 (1st Cir.1990) (nature of conduct involved in pending charges, based on record documentation, supports Sec. 4A1.3 departure).  But cf. U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3, p.s.  (prior arrest record alone not to be considered under Sec. 4A1.3);  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 949 (citing Williams, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1117).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grave signs of recidivism relied on by the district court likewise weighed heavily in favor of a substantial upward departure as well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The pending Massachusetts false pretenses and larceny charges and the Rhode Island banking law charge involved alleged conduct similar to the instant credit card fraud offense, and Fahm's flight to avoid prosecution in this case is a carbon copy of his uncharged conduct of failing to answer to the Massachusetts charges following release pending prosecution.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3(e), p.s.  The Rhode Island obstruction charge, based on Fahm's alleged use of an alias to mislead a police officer, occurred while he was awaiting sentencing on the instant offense as well, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3(d) (committing crime while awaiting sentencing is a factor to be weighed under Sec. 4A1.3), as did the pending charge for failing to appear for sentencing in Rhode Island federal district court.  These charges and the uncharged analogous conduct all involved criminal activity within two years of the offenses of conviction.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(e) (two-point criminal history increase to reflect recency of offense);  Figaro, 935 F.2d at 7 (treating recency of offense as evidence of recidivism) (Sec. 4A1.3 departure).  The district court further found that Fahm had been treated leniently in the past, and had persisted--before and since the offenses of conviction--in the same pattern of credit fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given Fahm's significantly underrepresented criminal history and his serious recidivism, as evidenced by the recency of his criminal conduct and his commission of criminal offenses while released awaiting prosecution on other charges, the degree of the departure imposed by the district court was reasonable.  See generally United States v. Joan, 883 F.2d 491, 496 (6th Cir.1989) (adopting Diaz-Villafane three-step analysis and assigning as factors in determining reasonableness of departure:  the seriousness of the past conduct, recidivism risk, conduct not resulting in convictions, previous lenient treatment, and deterrent effect) (combined Sec. 4A1.3 and Sec. 5K2.0 departure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>B. Reconsideration of Original Sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the September 30 sentencing, after overruling Fahm's objection to the Sec. 4A1.3 departure ruling and denying his request to stay \"imposition\" of sentence, the court immediately proceeded to impose the twenty-month prison sentence but nonetheless allowed defense counsel two weeks within which to submit written opposition to the departure ruling.  At the second sentencing hearing, on December 22, the district court declined to reconsider its Sec. 4A1.3 departure ruling, then indicated that it intended to correct an earlier oversight by increasing Fahm's ABOL by two levels for unlawful flight from prosecution.  Defense counsel objected that the court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 but made no explicit reference to the seven-day limitation period in Rule 35(c).  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c);  infra at p. 453.  The court then increased the original prison sentence to twenty-one months, bringing it within the revised 21-to-27 month GSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Fahm claims that the district court lacked jurisdiction to increase the sentence originally imposed on September 30.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c).  The government, on the other hand, characterizes the December 22 hearing as a mere continuation of the first hearing, and accordingly contends that the seven-day limitation period in Rule 35(c) was not implicated.  Alternatively, the government argues that the district court possessed inherent power to reconsider the original sentence notwithstanding the limitation period in Rule 35(c).  We conclude that neither government theory is tenable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

See United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 866 (1st Cir.1993) (noting likelihood that \"imposition of sentence,\" within meaning of Rule 35(c), occurs on date judgment entered) (dictum) (citing United States v. Zuleta-Molina, 840 F.2d 157, 158 n. 1 (1st Cir.1988));  United States v. Carr, 932 F.2d 67, 69 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 112, 116 L.Ed.2d 82 (1991);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(1) (\"The judgment shall be signed by the judge and entered by the clerk.\" ).  Moreover, the September 30 hearing transcript reflects that the court pronounced the original sentence after overruling Fahm's objection to the Sec. 4A1.3 departure.  Later in the hearing, defense counsel sought to stay imposition of sentence pending submission of opposition to the Sec. 4A1.3 departure.  Although the court categorically denied a stay--leaving its twenty-month sentence in place--it allowed defense counsel time to submit written opposition.  The district court record thus belies any interpretation that sentence was not imposed on September 30.  Consequently, we must decide whether the original sentence was subject to reconsideration by the district court on December 22, well beyond the time allowed under Rule 35(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 35(c) states:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>(c) Correction of Sentence by Sentencing Court.

Compare Carr, 932 F.2d at 71 n. 5 (pre-Rule 35(c) case).  The relevant case law likewise compels the conclusion that the district court lacked jurisdiction to correct its original sentence beyond the limitation period prescribed in Rule 35(c).

As for the evidence that Fahm absconded before sentencing on the instant charges, the public record is irrefutable.  See United States v. Garcia, 978 F.2d 746, 749 (1st Cir.1992) (upholding Sec. 4A1.3 departure where there was no dispute that defendant committed offenses after absconding on another charge).

Emery, 991 F.2d 907, 913-14 (1st Cir.1993) (where \"the sentencing court[ ] [has] articulated grounds for departing [which] permit us adequately to assess the reasonableness of the departure.... [n]o more is exigible.\"), we note that the reasonableness of the district court's decision to depart to CHC IV is strongly supported by the unadjudicated state and federal charges pending against Fahm, and by analogous criminal conduct not reflected in the original CHC calculation.  There are two felony charges pending against Fahm in Massachusetts, dating from 1988, for larceny of an automobile and obtaining property under false pretenses, see Mass.Gen.L. ch. 266 Secs. 27A(a), 30, 34.  Further, after Fahm defaulted on these two charges, a warrant issued;  this default conduct is analogous to a federal charge of flight from prosecution, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1073(1);  see also Aymelek, 926 F.2d at 71 (federal law governs classification of criminal conduct for guideline sentencing purposes).  Moreover, there is a felony charge outstanding against Fahm for violating Rhode Island banking laws in 1990, see R.I.Gen.L. Sec. 19-19-2 (issuing fraudulent check), and another 1990 Rhode Island state charge for obstructing a police officer with the use of an alias, see R.I.Gen.L. Sec. 11-32-1 (up to one year in prison), see also Moore, 931 F.2d at 5 n. 3 (minor convictions, in aggregate, can show pattern of conduct supporting finding of recidivism)</p>\n        <p>Yet pending as well is a federal felony charge for failure to appear at the sentencing hearing originally scheduled for January, 1991.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3146(a)(1).  Finally, the CHC calculation in the PSR did not reflect that Fahm committed the offenses of conviction after having defaulted (i.e., failed to appear) on the Massachusetts charges, which would warrant two additional CH points.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(d) (add two points if instant offense committed while on bail).</p>\n        <p>These pending state and federal charges, combined with the two-point Sec. 4A1.1(d) increase and the analogous uncharged criminal conduct, would aggregate eight additional criminal points at a minimum.  Ascribing even a single criminal history point to each pending state charge, and one to the pending federal charge, would result in five points.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(a), (b), (c) (assigning, respectively, three points for sentence above thirteen months, two points for sentences between three and thirteen months, and one point for under three months).  Neither these pending charges, nor the analogous conduct (amounting to an additional one point), nor the two-point Sec. 4A1.1(d) increase, were taken into account in the CHC calculation, which totalled three criminal history points.  Thus, at its lowest range (8 points), the pending charges, analogous conduct, and the Sec. 4A1.1(d) increase, combined with the three points originally assigned, would indicate a level V CHC.

Less than one month later, while released pending sentencing, he was arrested for obstructing a Rhode Island police officer in connection with a motor vehicle violation, whereupon he fled, failed to report to his pretrial services officer, and violated bail by absenting himself from the federal sentencing hearing scheduled for January 1991.  Shortly thereafter Fahm committed the crime of attempted credit card fraud, for which he was convicted and sentenced in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.  After serving a five-month sentence on the latter charge, Fahm was returned to the District of Rhode Island for sentencing on the offenses of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>A.

In far less egregious circumstances we have sustained an upward departure where the offenses of conviction were committed while the defendant was awaiting final disposition of similar state charge.  See Calderon, 935 F.2d at 12.   Fahm committed these offenses while awaiting disposition of similar Massachusetts charges (larceny of an automobile and obtaining property under false pretenses) which had yet to result in conviction.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3(e).  Furthermore, while awaiting sentencing on the instant offenses, he committed a similar credit-fraud felony in Delaware.  See United States v.

Thus, the district court reasonably concluded that CHC II under-represented Fahm's actual criminal history, a finding well supported, inter alia, by the similar credit-fraud related charges committed within two years of the instant offenses, evidencing a serious pattern of recidivism not reflected in the conventional CHC calculation under U.S.S.G. Secs. 4A1.1 and 4A1.2.

See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3(e), p.s.  The Rhode Island obstruction charge, based on Fahm's alleged use of an alias to mislead a police officer, occurred while he was awaiting sentencing on the instant offense as well, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3(d) (committing crime while awaiting sentencing is a factor to be weighed under Sec. 4A1.3), as did the pending charge for failing to appear for sentencing in Rhode Island federal district court.  These charges and the uncharged analogous conduct all involved criminal activity within two years of the offenses of conviction.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(e) (two-point criminal history increase to reflect recency of offense);  Figaro, 935 F.2d at 7 (treating recency of offense as evidence of recidivism) (Sec. 4A1.3 departure).

At the second sentencing hearing, on December 22, the district court declined to reconsider its Sec. 4A1.3 departure ruling, then indicated that it intended to correct an earlier oversight by increasing Fahm's ABOL by two levels for unlawful flight from prosecution.  Defense counsel objected that the court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 but made no explicit reference to the seven-day limitation period in Rule 35(c).  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c);  infra at p. 453.

The government, on the other hand, characterizes the December 22 hearing as a mere continuation of the first hearing, and accordingly contends that the seven-day limitation period in Rule 35(c) was not implicated.  Alternatively, the government argues that the district court possessed inherent power to reconsider the original sentence notwithstanding the limitation period in Rule 35(c).

Moreover, the September 30 hearing transcript reflects that the court pronounced the original sentence after overruling Fahm's objection to the Sec. 4A1.3 departure.  Later in the hearing, defense counsel sought to stay imposition of sentence pending submission of opposition to the Sec. 4A1.3 departure.  Although the court categorically denied a stay--leaving its twenty-month sentence in place--it allowed defense counsel time to submit written opposition.  The district court record thus belies any interpretation that sentence was not imposed on September 30.  Consequently, we must decide whether the original sentence was subject to reconsideration by the district court on December 22, well beyond the time allowed under Rule 35(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 35(c) states:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>(c) Correction of Sentence by Sentencing Court.

[n]o more is exigible.\"), we note that the reasonableness of the district court's decision to depart to CHC IV is strongly supported by the unadjudicated state and federal charges pending against Fahm, and by analogous criminal conduct not reflected in the original CHC calculation.  There are two felony charges pending against Fahm in Massachusetts, dating from 1988, for larceny of an automobile and obtaining property under false pretenses, see Mass.Gen.L. ch. 266 Secs. 27A(a), 30, 34.  Further, after Fahm defaulted on these two charges, a warrant issued;  this default conduct is analogous to a federal charge of flight from prosecution, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1073(1);  see also Aymelek, 926 F.2d at 71 (federal law governs classification of criminal conduct for guideline sentencing purposes).  Moreover, there is a felony charge outstanding against Fahm for violating Rhode Island banking laws in 1990, see R.I.Gen.L. Sec. 19-19-2 (issuing fraudulent check), and another 1990 Rhode Island state charge for obstructing a police officer with the use of an alias, see R.I.Gen.L. Sec. 11-32-1 (up to one year in prison), see also Moore, 931 F.2d at 5 n. 3 (minor convictions, in aggregate, can show pattern of conduct supporting finding of recidivism)</p>\n        <p>Yet pending as well is a federal felony charge for failure to appear at the sentencing hearing originally scheduled for January, 1991.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3146(a)(1).  Finally, the CHC calculation in the PSR did not reflect that Fahm committed the offenses of conviction after having defaulted (i.e., failed to appear) on the Massachusetts charges, which would warrant two additional CH points.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(d) (add two points if instant offense committed while on bail).</p>\n        <p>These pending state and federal charges, combined with the two-point Sec. 4A1.1(d) increase and the analogous uncharged criminal conduct, would aggregate eight additional criminal points at a minimum.  Ascribing even a single criminal history point to each pending state charge, and one to the pending federal charge, would result in five points.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.1(a), (b), (c) (assigning, respectively, three points for sentence above thirteen months, two points for sentences between three and thirteen months, and one point for under three months).  Neither these pending charges, nor the analogous conduct (amounting to an additional one point), nor the two-point Sec. 4A1.1(d) increase, were taken into account in the CHC calculation, which totalled three criminal history points.  Thus, at its lowest range (8 points), the pending charges, analogous conduct, and the Sec. 4A1.1(d) increase, combined with the three points originally assigned, would indicate a level V CHC.
