This petition for habeas corpus\n\nseeks relief from the denial of petitioner's motion for a new trial\n\nin the state court.               In pursuing a new trial, petitioner argued\n\nthat (1) the trial court's denial of defense counsel's motion for\n\na continuance at the beginning of the trial was \"so arbitrary as to\n\nviolate due process,\" and (2) defense counsel's subsequent conduct\n\nat   trial   violated            the   petitioner's    Sixth    Amendment     right   to\n\ncounsel.     In asserting those arguments here, petitioner contends\n\nthat the state courts' denial of his motion for a new trial was\n\ncontrary     to,           and   an    unreasonable     application     of,     clearly\n\nestablished federal law.                Unpersuaded, we affirm the decision of\n\nthe district court denying the petition for habeas corpus relief.\n\n                                             I.\n\n             On    September           27,   1996,    petitioner,     Juan    Castillo\n\n(\"Castillo\"), was convicted by a jury in the Massachusetts Superior\n\nCourt of trafficking in a controlled substance (cocaine), and was\n\nsentenced    to        a    mandatory     minimum    sentence    of   fifteen    years.\n\nCastillo appealed his conviction to the Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt.   On April 15, 1998, Castillo filed a motion in the Superior\n\nCourt for a new trial arguing that (1) the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion        in        denying     defense     counsel    Christine      Fernandez\n\n(\"Fernandez\") a continuance, and (2) that Fernandez's lack of\n\nknowledge of the law, failure to interview or prepare Castillo,\n\nmischaracterization of Castillo's testimony in closing argument,\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fand failure to call relevant witnesses was ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the\n\nSixth Amendment.       By an order entered June 15, 1998, the trial\n\njudge   denied   the   motion   without     discovery    or    an   evidentiary\n\nhearing, finding that no continuance was necessary because the\n\nfiling of counsel's appearance was a representation that she was\n\n\"ready,   willing,     and   able\"   to    try   the   case,    and   that   her\n\nperformance was not ineffective.           Commonwealth v. Castillo, No.\n\n9477 CR 3461 (Mass. Superior Ct. June 15, 1998)(order denying\n\ndefendant's motion for new trial).           Castillo's appeal from this\n\norder was consolidated with his direct appeal.                On June 8, 1999,\n\nthe Appeals Court summarily affirmed Castillo's conviction and the\n\ndenial of his new trial motion \"substantially for those reasons set\n\nout in the trial judge's memorandum of decision.\"              Commonwealth v.\n\nCastillo, No. 97-P-1937 (Mass. App. Ct. June 8, 1999)(mem. & order\n\naffirming defendant's conviction and denial of motion for a new\n\ntrial). The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts denied further\n\nappellate review. Commonwealth v. Castillo, No. FAR-10783 (Mass.\n\nSept. 27, 1999)(notice of denial of further appellate review).\n\n           On September 11, 2000, Castillo petitioned the federal\n\ndistrict court for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254,\n\nclaiming that the state court's rejection of his two new trial\n\nclaims -- a due process violation in denying the continuance and\n\nineffective assistance of counsel -- warranted habeas relief.                 On\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fMarch 22, 2001, the district court referred the petition to a\n\nUnited States magistrate judge for a recommended disposition.   On\n\nJuly 6, 2001, the magistrate judge issued a thorough Report and\n\nRecommendation recommending that the petition be dismissed.     On\n\nJuly 17, Castillo timely objected to three factual determinations\n\ncontained in the report.1   By an order dated July 27, 2001, the\n\ndistrict court rejected Castillo's objections and adopted the\n\nreport in its entirety.2    On August 1, 2002, the district court\n\n\n     1\n         The Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge\ncontained a clear notice that \"any party who objects to these\nproposed findings and recommendations must file a written objection\nthereto . . . within 10 days. . . . [F]ailure to comply with this\nrule shall preclude further appellate review.\" Castillo v.\nMatesanz, No. 00-11854 (D. Mass. July 6, 2001) (Report and\nRecommendation of United States magistrate judge). Despite this\nclear warning, Castillo made limited objections to the magistrate\njudge's report.    Respondent rightly argues that \"none of the\nproposed factual findings [to which petitioner objected], even if\nerroneous, provides a basis for habeas relief.       The remaining\naspects of petitioner's appeal comprise matters to which no\nobjection was made and, therefore, are waived and not properly\nbefore this Court.\" In most circumstances we would enforce this\nimportant rule of waiver. See Keating v. Sec'y of Health and Human\nServs., 848 F.2d 271 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"[O]nly those issues fairly\nraised by the objections to the magistrate's report are subject to\nreview in the district court and those not preserved by such\nobjection are precluded on appeal.\").       However, this rule is\nprocedural, not jurisdictional. Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 146\n(1985). Strictly applied here, this rule would mean that we would\nnot be addressing the merits of any of Castillo's arguments on\nappeal, and there might be further claims of ineffective assistance\nof counsel in these post-conviction proceedings. In the interest\nof finality, therefore, we proceed to affirm on the merits the\ndistrict court's denial of habeas relief.\n     2\n         Because the district court accepted and adopted the\ndetailed Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge, we do\nnot distinguish between the two judicial officers in the interest\nof simplicity. Rather, for the duration of the opinion, we refer\n\n                                -4-\n\fexplained    its   decision   to    grant    Castillo    a   certificate    of\n\nappealability.     \"While a strong case has been made that counsel's\n\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\n\nbecause of her utter lack of preparation, I agreed (and still\n\nagree) with the magistrate judge that petitioner has not shown that\n\nprejudice resulted.       Nonetheless, habeas appellate counsel has\n\nvaliantly made enough of a showing to persuade me that an appeal is\n\nappropriate.\"      Castillo v. Matesanz, No. 00-11854-PBS (August 1,\n\n2002) (certificate of appealability).\n\n                                     II.\n\n            We first give a brief summary of the circumstances of the\n\noffense and some pretrial history.             We then recount the facts\n\nrelevant to the request for a continuance and the ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claims.\n\nA.   The Offense and Some Pretrial History\n\n            At about 8 p.m. on October 30, 1994, two police officers\n\nfor the city of Lynn received a radio report of a disturbance at\n\n102 Cottage Street. Upon arrival, the residents of the first floor\n\napartment   let    the   officers   into    the    three-unit    building   and\n\ndirected them upstairs.        The officers proceeded to the second\n\nfloor, which was empty and unlit, where they heard footsteps coming\n\nfrom the third floor. Officer Griffin proceeded to the third floor\n\napartment    and   knocked    on    the    door,   identifying    himself    as\n\n\nto the determinations below as those of the district court.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f\"policia.\"      Officer Hogan went up the back stairs to the third\n\nfloor, where he heard the back door unlock and saw Castillo begin\n\nto emerge from the doorway.           Castillo then turned and went back\n\ninto the apartment.       Officer Hogan entered through the back door,\n\nsaw a second man in the apartment's bathroom holding a plastic bag\n\ncontaining a white substance, and heard the toilet flushing.                The\n\nofficer then saw a third man in the kitchen making a throwing\n\ngesture towards the window.           On the ground beneath the kitchen\n\nwindow,   the    police    later     recovered   two   clear    plastic   bags\n\ncontaining approximately 169 grams of cocaine.                 Castillo and a\n\nfourth man were standing next to the kitchen table, on which\n\nOfficer Hogan observed a partially open brown paper bag containing\n\nseveral plastic sandwich bags filled with a white powder, and two\n\ndigital scales. Castillo was never seen in physical custody of any\n\ncontrolled substance.       The officers arrested Castillo and brought\n\nhim to the police station, where officers found a beeper and $467\n\nin cash on his person.\n\n             On December 14, 1994, a Massachusetts grand jury indicted\n\nCastillo for trafficking in 200 grams or more of cocaine, and\n\nconspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act.               Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws Ann. ch. 94c, §§ 32E, 40 (2003).         At Castillo's arraignment on\n\nJanuary   11,   1995,     attorney    Kirk   Bransfield   was   appointed    to\n\nrepresent him.     After deciding a variety of pretrial motions and\n\nafter a number of continuances, the trial court scheduled the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fbeginning of trial for December 13, 1995.3       Castillo failed to\n\nappear on December 13, and an arrest warrant issued. Approximately\n\nsix months later, Castillo was arrested at a New York airport and\n\nremanded to Massachusetts for trial.   Trial was scheduled to begin\n\non September 23, 1996.\n\nB.   Attorney Fernandez's Appearance\n\n           On August 5, 1996, Christine Fernandez, an attorney with\n\nthe New York law firm of Aranda & Guttlein, filed a motion to\n\nappear pro hac vice in this matter.      On the same day, attorney\n\nAndres M. Aranda, a partner of the Aranda & Guttlein law firm, also\n\nmoved to appear pro hac vice but his motion was not docketed or\n\nacted upon by the court.   In an affidavit filed in support of her\n\nmotion, Fernandez stated that she had been a member in good\n\nstanding of the New York bar since 1996 and that she \"specialize[d]\n\nin criminal and federal law.\"   On September 9, Fernandez appeared\n\nin person before a Superior Court judge, who allowed the motion to\n\nappear pro hac vice on the express \"condition that the trial date\n\nof September 23, 1996 remain the scheduled trial date and that the\n\nallowance of this motion not delay the trial.\"    On that same day,\n\nFernandez filed a notice of appearance, and attorney Bransfield,\n\nthe court-appointed counsel, withdrew.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n        Although all of the men present in the apartment on the\nnight in question were arrested, Castillo was tried alone.\n\n                                -7-\n\f          On     September     12,   1996,       attorney    Jorge    Guttlein\n\n(\"Guttlein\"), another partner of the Aranda & Guttlein law firm,\n\nsent a letter to the court together with an undated motion to\n\nappear pro hac vice.        In the letter, Guttlein acknowledged that\n\nCastillo's    trial   was    scheduled     for   September    23,    1996,   but\n\nrequested that trial be continued until October 17 because he had\n\na scheduling conflict.       The trial court treated this letter as a\n\nmotion for a continuance, which it denied.             Castillo's case was\n\nsubsequently transferred from Essex Superior Court to Lawrence\n\nSuperior Court for trial on September 24, 1996.             Guttlein appeared\n\nbefore the Lawrence Superior Court on September 24, 1996, and his\n\nmotion to appear pro hac vice was allowed that day.                  Castillo's\n\ncase was not called for trial that day but was continued to the\n\nnext morning.\n\n             Fernandez appeared in court the next morning and informed\n\nthe judge that Guttlein had been \"called back to New York late\n\nyesterday afternoon because his wife was ill.\"               Fernandez stated\n\nthat she was appearing on Castillo's behalf and that she had\n\nreviewed all the pretrial motions and was prepared to argue them,\n\nbut that she had a \"series of requests\" regarding her \"late entry\n\ninto the case this morning.\"         She sought a further delay in the\n\ntrial:\n\n             I arrived in Massachusetts last night at about\n             four a.m. because the roads were awful with\n             the rain and everything else. I have had very\n             little opportunity to review this file.      I\n\n                                     -8-\n\f            understand that we're scheduled to go forward,\n            and I'm prepared to at least go forward with\n            jury selection.    However, I would ask your\n            Honor please not to go forward with any\n            testimony until I've had an opportunity to\n            further review this file.\n\nThe trial judge responded that Fernandez's motion to appear was\n\nallowed several weeks ago \"with the specific condition that it not\n\ndelay the trial.\"      Fernandez argued that at the time she was\n\nadmitted to appear pro hac vice, she \"was not under the impression\n\nthat [she] would be trying this case\" since Guttlein has been\n\n\"slotted to try this case.\"     The judge replied:\n\n            [Y]our firm was on notice that whoever was\n            going to try this case was going to be\n            prepared for it. And the Court doesn't look\n            behind appearances when you have two or three\n            people, all of whom are on there. Everyone is\n            presumed to be ready, willing and able to try\n            the case.\n\nHowever, the judge stated that he did not know how far they would\n\nget that day, although it seemed likely they would get through\n\nimpanelment and opening statements.          He deferred ruling on the\n\nrequest to delay any testimony until later in the day.             After\n\nimpanelment    and   opening   statements,    the   judge   recessed   the\n\nproceedings for an hour and a half, stating that the Commonwealth\n\nwould call its first witness following the recess and Fernandez\n\nwould be called on to cross-examine the witness.            Although this\n\nstatement implicitly denied the request for a one-day delay of\n\ntestimony, Fernandez did not voice any further objections to the\n\nschedule.\n\n                                  -9-\n\fC.   Castillo's Trial Strategy\n\n             Castillo was charged with trafficking in a controlled\n\nsubstance, an offense with the following elements: (1) knowing or\n\nintentional possession of a controlled substance, (2) with the\n\nspecific intent to distribute the controlled substance, and (3) if\n\nthe controlled substance is cocaine (as defined in Mass. Gen. Laws.\n\nAnn. ch. 94C § 31), the controlled substance has a net weight of\n\nfourteen grams or more.        Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94c, § 32E(b).\n\nThe statute sets out escalating penalties for amounts in excess of\n\nthe fourteen grams necessary for conviction.                  Specifically, the\n\nstatute sets a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for 28\n\ngrams or more but less than 100 grams, and a mandatory minimum\n\nsentence of fifteen years for 200 grams or more.                Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nAnn. ch. 94c, § 32E(2), (4).             Two lesser included offenses of\n\ntrafficking are possession with intent to distribute and simple\n\npossession.        To gain a trafficking conviction rather than the\n\nlesser   offense     of   possession     with   intent   to    distribute,   the\n\nprosecution must establish possession with intent to distribute a\n\nminimum weight of fourteen grams of cocaine.             Simple possession is\n\nmerely knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance\n\n--   there    is    no    \"intent   to   distribute\"     or     minimum   weight\n\nrequirement.       Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94c, § 34.         The sentence for\n\nsimple possession is imprisonment for not more than one year.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f          Castillo's trial strategy was to win a not guilty verdict\n\nby defeating the prosecution's proof of the first element of the\n\ntrafficking offense:      knowing or intentional possession of a\n\ncontrolled substance.     Thus, attorney Fernandez did not contest\n\nthat the substance in question found at the apartment was cocaine\n\nand that the amount of the substance was 200 grams or more.\n\nInstead, she argued that Castillo did not know there were any drugs\n\nin the apartment or that the other people in the apartment were\n\nengaged in drug dealing.     Castillo was merely present in someone\n\nelse's apartment where drugs happened to be found.\n\n          The Commonwealth opened its case by calling Officer Hogan\n\nto the stand, who testified to the activities he witnessed in the\n\napartment.      In accordance with her trial strategy, Fernandez\n\nestablished through her cross-examination of Officer Hogan that he\n\ndid not see Castillo handle any of the drugs and that in order to\n\nbe able to see the drugs inside the bag on the kitchen table, a\n\nperson had to be standing over the bag.     She further established\n\nthat if Castillo had been sitting at the kitchen table he would not\n\nhave been able to see into the bag that was on the table.\n\n             The following morning, the Commonwealth called Officer\n\nGriffin, who testified in a manner similar to Officer Hogan about\n\nthe events leading to Castillo's arrest and added that at the\n\npolice station a beeper and $467 in cash were recovered from\n\nCastillo's person.     On cross-examination, Fernandez   established\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fthat not all beepers are used to conduct drug transactions and that\n\nno   drugs     were   ever    found   in     Castillo's      possession.      The\n\nCommonwealth also called Lieutenant Stevens who testified generally\n\nabout the drug trade in Lynn at the time of Castillo's arrest.\n\n              At the conclusion of the Commonwealth's case, Fernandez\n\nmoved   for    a   judgment    of   acquittal    on    the    ground   that   the\n\nCommonwealth's evidence established only Castillo's \"mere presence\n\nin an apartment where narcotics\" were seized and that this was\n\ninsufficient to establish guilt under Massachusetts law. The judge\n\ndenied the motion.      Fernandez then called Castillo to the stand to\n\nexplain the circumstances of his presence in Lynn and to offer his\n\naccount of what transpired on the night of his arrest.                  Castillo\n\ntestified that he was a resident of the Bronx, New York, where he\n\nlived   with    his   wife    and   daughter.     He    worked    in   Manhattan\n\ndelivering clothes for a weekly income of $260 to $280.                    He had\n\ncome to Lynn to help his former mother-in-law locate his missing\n\nson, and the cash he brought with him was to buy clothes and gifts\n\nfor his son.       While in Lynn he met Rodriguez, a resident of the\n\napartment, at a \"telephone place\" (a business providing inexpensive\n\nlong distance telephone service as an alternative to pay phones),\n\nwhere they spoke on several occasions.                 On October 30, 1994,\n\nRodriguez invited Castillo to his apartment at 102 Cottage Street.\n\nAfter being at the apartment for ten or fifteen minutes, Castillo\n\ntestified that he got up to leave and was confronted by a police\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fofficer as he attempted to exit the back door.           Castillo denied\n\nhaving any knowledge of any drugs in the apartment prior to the\n\narrival of the police officers.\n\n            After the examination of witnesses, the Court reviewed\n\nthe jury charge.        Fernandez rejected an instruction on simple\n\npossession offered by the trial judge.            Although she initially\n\nrequested   a   joint   venture   instruction,4   Fernandez   immediately\n\nobjected to the judge's decision to offer such an instruction when\n\nshe fully comprehended the significance of it.           After receiving\n\ninstructions from the judge, the jury returned a verdict that\n\nCastillo was guilty of trafficking in 200 grams or more of cocaine.\n\n                                   III.\n\n            The standard of review for this habeas corpus petition is\n\nset forth in the AEDPA statute, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244-2266 (2002).         On\n\nthe grounds pertinent to this case, a federal court may grant\n\nhabeas relief to a state prisoner if it finds, inter alia, that the\n\n\n\n     4\n        As the judge instructed the jury, \"[i]nherent in the idea\nof joint venture liability is that he aided and abetted and, as so,\nshares the same mental intent and is guilty to the same extent as\na principal who commits the crime.\" To establish liability under\na joint venture theory under Massachusetts law, the prosecution\nmust prove (1) that the defendant was present at the scene of the\ncrime, (2) that the defendant had knowledge that another intended\nto commit the crime and that he shared that intent himself, and (3)\nthat the defendant by agreement was willing and available to help\nthe other in carrying out the crime if necessary.        For joint\nventure liability, the prosecution is not required to show that\n\"the defendant physically participated in the actual offense in the\nsense that he actually or constructively possessed a controlled\nsubstance.\"\n\n                                   -13-\n\fstate court adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary\n\nto, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\nFederal law . . . .\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).        This section \"defines\n\ntwo categories of cases in which a state prisoner may obtain\n\nfederal habeas relief with respect to a claim adjudicated on the\n\nmerits in state court.\"       Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 404\n\n(2000).    Under the \"contrary to\" prong, a federal court may grant\n\nthe writ if the state court \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to\n\nthat reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the\n\nstate court decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] has\n\non a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\"             Id. at 412-13.\n\nUnder the \"unreasonable application\" prong, a federal court may\n\ngrant the writ if the state court \"identifies the correct governing\n\nlegal     principle   from   [the    Supreme]    Court's     decisions   but\n\nunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's\n\ncase.\"     Id. at 413.       In the latter case, the state court's\n\ndetermination must be unreasonable, not simply incorrect, and\n\nunreasonableness is an objective standard.         Id. at 410-11.    \"If it\n\nis a close question whether the state decision is in error, then\n\nthe   state    decision   cannot    be   an   unreasonable    application.\"\n\nMcCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 36 (1st Cir. 2002)(en banc).\n\nA.    Denial of Request for a Continuance\n\n              Castillo contends that the trial court's denial of a\n\ncontinuance was \"so arbitrary as to violate due process.\"            In his\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fchallenge to the state court's failure to grant his motion for a\n\nnew trial on this basis, he claims that this denial constituted an\n\nunreasonable   application   of   clearly   established   Supreme   Court\n\nprecedent5 because it\n\n           gave   no   weight  to   counsel's   lack   of\n           preparation and experience, drew an improper\n           presumption that counsel was \"ready willing\n           and able\" to try the case from the fact of her\n           appearance in the face of her representation\n           to the contrary, and misrepresented the roles\n           of the various members of the law firm in a\n           way that is misleading and beside the point.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n           The only Supreme Court precedent that Castillo identifies\n\nfor purposes of the \"unreasonable application\" analysis is Ungar v.\n\nSarafite, 376 U.S. 575 (1964).    The Supreme Court held that a trial\n\njudge's decision not to grant the defendant in a contempt hearing\n\na one-week continuance did not offend the requirements of due\n\nprocess.\n\n           The matter of continuance is traditionally\n           within the discretion of the trial judge, and\n           it is not every denial of a request for more\n           time that violates due process even if the\n           party fails to offer evidence or is compelled\n           to defend without counsel.    Contrariwise, a\n           myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the\n           face of a justifiable request for delay can\n           render the right to defend with counsel an\n           empty formality.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n        Castillo does not argue that the trial court's denial of\nhis request for a continuance was contrary to Supreme Court\nprecedent.\n\n                                  -15-\n\fId. (internal citations omitted).      The Court added that \"[t]here\n\nare no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance\n\nis so arbitrary as to violate due process.\"          Id.    Instead,\n\nreviewing courts must examine \"the circumstances present in every\n\ncase, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at\n\nthe time the request is denied.\"        Id.   However, \"[n]ot every\n\nrestriction on counsel's time or opportunity to investigate or to\n\nconsult with his client or otherwise to prepare for trial violates\n\na defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\" Morris v. Slappy,\n\n461 U.S. 1, 11 (1983).\n\n          We recently applied Ungar's case-specific inquiry to a\n\ndenial of a continuance, holding that a reviewing court must look\n\nat \"the reasons contemporaneously presented in support of the\n\nrequest for the continuance.\"     We also identified a number of\n\nrelevant factors:\n\n          the amount of time needed for effective\n          preparation, the amount of time actually\n          available for preparation, the amount of time\n          previously available for preparation and how\n          assiduously the movant used that time, the\n          extent to which the movant has contributed to\n          his perceived predicament, the complexity of\n          the case, the availability of assistance from\n          other sources, the probable utility of a\n          continuance, the extent of inconvenience to\n          others . . . should a continuance ensue, and\n          the likelihood of an injustice or unfair\n          prejudice attributable to the denial of a\n          continuance.\n\nUnited States v. Saccochia, 58 F.3d 754, 770 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f            Due    to     the   summary      nature   of   the   Appeals   Court's\n\naffirmance, our review of the state courts' application of federal\n\nlaw to the request for a continuance requires us to review the\n\ndecision of the trial court denying Castillo's motion for a new\n\ntrial.   In its denial of Castillo's motion for a new trial, the\n\ntrial court noted that the trial originally had been scheduled for\n\nSeptember 23, 1996, that Fernandez had presented a motion to appear\n\npro hac vice and had made a corresponding appearance almost two\n\nmonths before the scheduled trial date, and that, in allowing the\n\nmotion, the court put Fernandez on notice that the impending trial\n\nwould not be delayed.           Thus, counsel had ample time to prepare.\n\nEven in pressing her last minute request for a brief continuance,\n\nFernandez made no representations to the trial judge that she had\n\nnever before tried a case and that her inexperience might make it\n\ndifficult   for     her    to   try   this    case    under   the   circumstances.\n\nFurthermore, in its order denying Castillo's motion for a new\n\ntrial, the trial court found that \"counsel's performance during the\n\ntrial did not reflect that of an attorney noticeably lacking in\n\neither experience or competence sufficient to meet constitutional\n\nstandards.\"       Commonwealth v. Castillo, No. 9477 CR 3461, slip op.\n\nat 4.\n\n            In submitting her motion to appear, Fernandez represented\n\nto the court that she was ready to try the case.                    Moreover, that\n\nmotion was allowed on the express condition that the trial date\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fremain as scheduled and the trial not be delayed.                  At no time did\n\nFernandez indicate to the judge that this was her first trial.                 To\n\nthe contrary, in her motion to appear, Fernandez explicitly stated\n\n\"I specialize in Criminal and Federal law.\"                  In light of the\n\ninformation before the trial judge at the time he made his decision\n\nand the \"great deal of latitude\" necessarily afforded judges in\n\nscheduling trials, Morris, 461 U.S. at 11, the decision not to\n\ngrant Castillo a new trial on the basis of the denial of his\n\nrequest for a continuance was not an unreasonable application of\n\nSupreme Court precedent.\n\nB.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n             In rejecting Castillo's motion for a new trial on the\n\nbasis of ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court found\n\nthat \"Attorney Fernandez's performance [was not] measurably below\n\nthat of an ordinarily fallible lawyer\" and \"defense counsel's\n\ntheory   of     the     case   was     not    'manifestly         unreasonable.'\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Castillo, No. 9477 CR 3461, slip op. at 5-6.\n\nCastillo argues that the \"manifestly unreasonable\" standard that\n\nthe trial court applied in assessing trial counsel's tactical\n\njudgment is contrary to the standard the Supreme Court prescribed\n\nin   Strickland.       Castillo     also   argues   that    the    state   court's\n\nevaluation     of     Fernandez's     performance     was     an     unreasonable\n\napplication of Strickland.            After a brief explanation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fStrickland standard, we explain our reasons for rejecting these\n\narguments on the merits.\n\n            1.   The Strickland Standard\n\n            In Strickland v. Washington, the Supreme Court set forth\n\nthe controlling principles for deciding ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claims.      Under these principles, a defendant alleging\n\nineffective assistance of counsel must establish two elements:\n\n            First, the defendant must show that counsel's\n            performance was deficient.      This requires\n            showing that counsel made errors so serious\n            that counsel was not functioning as the\n            \"counsel\" guaranteed the defendant by the\n            Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must\n            show that the deficient performance prejudiced\n            the defense.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687.        In addressing the first element,\n\n\"judicial    scrutiny   of   counsel's    performance   must   be   highly\n\ndeferential.\"     Id. at 689.    A reviewing court must leave \"ample\n\nroom for variations in professional judgment,\" Ouber v. Guarino,\n\n293 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n\n689), and \"every effort [must] be made to eliminate the distorting\n\neffects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's\n\nchallenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's\n\nperspective at the time.\"       Id. at 689.   Only if, \"in light of all\n\nthe circumstances, the identified acts or omissions of counsel were\n\noutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\" can\n\na finding of deficient performance ensue.        Id. at 690.\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f           Even     if    counsel's    performance      is    constitutionally\n\ndeficient, the second element of the Strickland standard requires\n\nthe   petitioner     to   demonstrate      that   \"there     is    a   reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the\n\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.\"                   Id. at 694.\n\nWhile    such   prejudice      may    be     presumed   in    a    few    limited\n\ncircumstances, such cases are the exception. See Bell v. Cone, 535\n\nU.S. 685, 695-96 (2002). Generally, the petitioner \"must carry the\n\ndevoir of persuasion and prove that he            was prejudiced, i.e. that\n\nhis attorney's parlous conduct may have altered the outcome of the\n\ncase.\"   Ouber, 293 F.3d at 25.        However, \"there is no reason for a\n\ncourt deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the\n\ninquiry in [] order or even to address both components of the\n\ninquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 697.               Hence we address primarily the\n\nperformance component of the Strickland standard.\n\n           2.     Contrary to Strickland\n\n           In     evaluating   Castillo's       ineffective       assistance   of\n\ncounsel claim, the state court used the following standard:\n\n[Castillo] must demonstrate that defense counsel's performance fell\n\"measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary\nfallible lawyer\" and that such inadequacies likely deprived the\ndefendant of an otherwise available defense.       Commonwealth v.\nSaferian, 366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Counsel's tactical judgment\nmust be \"manifestly unreasonable\" to constitute ineffective\nassistance of counsel. Commonwealth v. White, 409 Mass 266, 273\n(1991).\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fCommonwealth v. Castillo, No. 9477 CR 3461, slip op. at 5-6.                In\n\nhis   brief     on   appeal   Castillo   argues   that    this    \"manifestly\n\nunreasonable\" standard is contrary to the federal standard set\n\nforth in      Strickland.     Ordinarily,   we    would   not    address   this\n\nargument, as it was not raised before the district court in either\n\nCastillo's original habeas petition or in his application for a\n\ncertificate of appealability.        Malave v. Carney Hosp., 170 F.3d\n\n217, 222 (1st Cir. 1999)(\"It is a bedrock rule of appellate\n\npractice that . . . matters not raised in the [district] court\n\ncannot be hawked for the first time on appeal.\"); see Kramer v.\n\nKemna, 21 F.3d 305, 308 (8th Cir. 1994) (In an appeal from a denial\n\nof a writ of habeas corpus, the court declined to consider issues\n\nnot raised before the district court, holding that the \"[f]ailure\n\nto give the district court a first opportunity to decide the merits\n\nof an argument constitutes a waiver of that argument.\"); Yohey v.\n\nCollins, 985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir. 1993) (same); Depree v.\n\nThomas, 946 F.2d 784, 793 (11th Cir. 1991) (same).\n\n              However,    an appellate court has discretion, in an\n\nexceptional case, to reach issues that were not raised below.\n\nUnited States v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir. 1990);\n\nUnited States v. Krynicki, 689 F.2d 289, 291-92 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\nWe have found the exercise of such discretion to be appropriate\n\nwhere the appellant's challenge \"raises an issue of constitutional\n\nmagnitude which, if meritorious, could substantially affect [the\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fappellant], and future defendants . . . .\" La Guardia, 902 F.2d at\n\n1013; see Federal Credit Union v. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921, 930 (1st\n\nCir.   1995)    (\"[C]ases    involving     important      constitutional     or\n\ngovernmental issues may be exceptional and, as such, there should\n\nbe a full treatment of all legal issues involved, whether squarely\n\nintroduced by the parties or not.\").        Castillo's argument that the\n\nstate court's \"manifestly unreasonable\" standard is contrary to\n\nStrickland raises an important question of law that can be resolved\n\non the existing record and that is \"almost certain to be presented\n\nin identical terms in other cases.\"         La Guardia, 902 F.2d at 1013.\n\nThe issue has been fully briefed on this appeal and was covered\n\nexhaustively at oral argument.       If this constitutional claim were\n\notherwise meritorious, failure to reach it because of a procedural\n\ndefault could result in \"a miscarriage of justice.\"                  See id.\n\nTherefore, we address the merits of Castillo's claim.\n\n           In   evaluating   whether     Castillo   was    denied   effective\n\nassistance of counsel, the trial court differentiated between\n\nallegations concerning the quality of counsel's performance and\n\nthose concerning the reasonableness of her tactical judgments.\n\nCommonwealth v. Castillo, No. 9477 CR 3461, slip op. at 5-6.                The\n\ntrial court cited Commonwealth v. Saferian, 315 N.E.2d 878, 883\n\n(1974),   for   the   proposition    that    Castillo      was   required   to\n\ndemonstrate that attorney Fernandez's performance fell \"measurably\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fbelow that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible\n\nlawyer.\"    It concluded that Castillo failed to meet this burden.\n\n            Castillo does not contest the trial court's use of the\n\nperformance standard articulated by the Massachusetts Supreme Court\n\nin Saferian, which we have described as the \"functional equivalent\n\nof Strickland.\"    Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19, 31 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nRather, Castillo argues that the trial court applied to counsel's\n\ntactical judgments a standard that was \"contrary to\" Strickland.6\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, we are not persuaded.\n\n            In its use of the phrase \"manifestly unreasonable,\" the\n\ntrial court cited Commonwealth v. White, 565 N.E.2d 1185, 1189-90\n\n(Mass. 1991), which in turn cited Commonwealth v. Adams, 375 N.E.2d\n\n681, 685 (Mass. 1978)(\"Although most cases involving a claim of\n\nineffective counsel concern counsel's lack of preparation, there\n\nmay be instances where the judgment of fully informed counsel may\n\nbe so manifestly unreasonable as to be unprotected by the labels of\n\n'trial     strategy'   or   'trial     tactics.'\").   In   White,   the\n\n\n\n     6\n          Castillo appears to suggest that the state court\nerroneously applied the \"manifestly unreasonable\" standard to each\nof the alleged errors of counsel that Castillo raised, regardless\nof whether these allegations related to trial counsel's strategic\ndecision-making or to her performance.     This is incorrect. The\ncourt applied the \"manifestly unreasonable\" standard to actions\nthat it characterized as tactical or strategic.      It applied a\ndifferent test to Castillo's claims relating to trial counsel's\ninadequate preparation, qualifications to conduct the trial, and\nperformance at the trial, concluding that \"Attorney Fernandez's\nperformance [was not] measurably below that of an ordinarily\nfallible lawyer.\"\n\n                                     -23-\n\fMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court quoted Saferian's standard for\n\nevaluating a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and then\n\nadded:\n\n     In cases where tactical or strategic decisions of\n     defendant's counsel are at issue, we conduct our review\n     with   some  deference   to   avoid   characterizing  as\n     unreasonable a defense that was merely unsuccessful. See\n     Commonwealth v. Rondeau, 378 Mass. 408, 413 (1979). See\n     also Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689-90\n     (1984). Rather than merely unreasonable, we require that\n     challenged tactical judgments must be \"manifestly\n     unreasonable.\" Commonwealth v. Adams, 374 Mass. 722, 728\n     (1978).\n\nWhite, 565 N.E.2d at 1190.    Thus, in support of the \"manifestly\n\nunreasonable\" language, the trial court cited to White, which\n\nrelied heavily on both Saferian and Strickland.      This \"manifestly\n\nunreasonable\" standard is not contrary to the standard set forth in\n\nStrickland.\n\n          In Strickland, the Supreme Court held that \"the proper\n\nstandard for attorney performance is that of reasonably effective\n\nassistance,\" and that \"[w]hen a convicted defendant complains of\n\nthe ineffectiveness of counsel's assistance, the defendant must\n\nshow that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard\n\nof reasonableness.\"   Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.    \"More specific\n\nguidelines are not appropriate . . . . The proper measure of\n\nattorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing\n\nprofessional norms.\" Id. at 688. Recently, in Williams v. Taylor,\n\nJustice O'Connor clarified what it means for a state court decision\n\nto be contrary to clearly established federal law:\n\n                               -24-\n\f     The word \"contrary\" is commonly understood to mean\n     \"diametrically different,\" \"opposite in character or\n     nature,\" or \"mutually opposed.\" The text of § 2254(d)(1)\n     therefore suggests that the state court's decision must\n     be substantially different from the relevant precedent of\n     this Court. . . . Take, for example, our decision in\n     Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).        If a\n     state court were to reject a prisoner's claim of\n     ineffective assistance of counsel on the grounds that the\n     prisoner had not established by a preponderance of the\n     evidence that the result of his criminal proceeding would\n     have   been    different,   that    decision    would   be\n     \"diametrically different,\" \"opposite in character or\n     nature,\"   and   \"mutually   opposed\"   to   our   clearly\n     established precedent because we held in Strickland that\n     the prisoner need only demonstrate a \"reasonable\n     probability that . . . the result of the proceeding would\n     have been different.\" Id. at 694.\n\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405-06 (2000).   By this example,\n\na state court decision imposing a heavier burden on a defendant\n\nendeavoring to make an ineffective assistance claim than that set\n\nforth in Strickland is contrary to Strickland.\n\n          However, Strickland also counsels that in evaluating the\n\nreasonableness of counsel's tactical or strategic choices, courts\n\nmust apply \"a heavy measure of deference to counsel's judgments.\"\n\nIn this context, \"the Supreme Court [in Strickland] cited with\n\napproval the approach to strategic decision-making of the Fifth\n\nCircuit Court of Appeals, which allowed challenges when 'the choice\n\nwas so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have\n\nmade it.'\"     Phoenix v. Matesanz, 233 F.3d 77, 82 n.2 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)(quoting Washington v. Strickland, 693 F.2d 1243, 1254 (5th\n\nCir. 1982)).    In addition to the First and Fifth Circuits, other\n\ncircuits have applied this \"patently unreasonable\" formulation to\n\n                                -25-\n\ftactical judgments.       See, e.g., Bullock v. Carver, 297 F.3d 1036,\n\n1046 (10th Cir. 2002); Dorsey v. Chapman, 262 F.3d 1181, 1186 (11th\n\nCir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1000 (2002).7                     The minor\n\nvariation in phraseology between \"patently\" and \"manifestly\" does\n\nnot render the Massachusetts standard contrary to federal law. See\n\nOuber, 293 F.3d at 32.            As the Supreme Court in Strickland\n\nimplicitly    affirmed    the    lower    court's   \"patently   unreasonable\"\n\nformulation    in   the   context    of    tactical   decision-making,     the\n\nstandard employed by the trial court in evaluating Castillo's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim was not \"diametrically\n\ndifferent,\"    \"opposite    in    character    or   nature,\"    or   \"mutually\n\nopposed\" to Strickland.\n\n\n\n     7\n        In citing with approval the Fifth Circuit's approach, the\nSupreme Court in Strickland noted that \"strategic choices made\nafter thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible\noptions are virtually unchallengeable,\" while \"strategic choices\nmade after less than complete investigation are reasonable\nprecisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments\nsupport the limitations on investigation.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n690-91. Thus, rather than simply characterizing trial counsel's\ntactical decisions as \"unconsidered blunders,\" Castillo might have\nargued that the trial court erred by failing to distinguish between\ninformed and uninformed tactical decision-making. However, those\nCircuits that have adopted the \"patently unreasonable\" formulation\nare divided on the question of whether Strickland accords\nheightened deference only to informed strategic choices. See Epsom\nv. Hall, 330 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2003)(applying the formulation\nto all strategic decision-making); Dorsey, 262 F.3d at 1186 (same);\ncf. Bullock v. Carver, 297 F.3d at 1046 (applying the standard to\ncounsel's \"fully-informed strategic choices\"). Therefore, even if\nCastillo had raised this argument directly, we would be unable to\nconclude that the state court's application of the \"manifestly\nunreasonable\" formula to all tactical judgments was contrary to\nStrickland.\n\n                                     -26-\n\f          3.    Unreasonable Application of Strickland\n\n          In his habeas petition to the district court, and now on\n\nappeal, Castillo argues that the trial court's resolution of the\n\nineffective    assistance      of   counsel   claim   was    an    unreasonable\n\napplication    of    clearly   established     federal      law.       Castillo's\n\ncomplaints fall into two broad categories.                  Under the first,\n\nCastillo alleges that Fernandez's failure to know the law resulted\n\nin the following errors:       (1) stipulating that the substance found\n\nin the apartment was cocaine and that the total amount of cocaine\n\nexceeded 200 grams; (2) rejecting jury instructions on the lesser\n\nincluded offenses of simple possession and possession with intent\n\nto distribute; and (3) requesting a harmful joint venture jury\n\ninstruction.    Under the second, Castillo alleges that Fernandez's\n\nfailure to know the facts caused her to (1) call Castillo to the\n\nstand after inadequate preparation; and (2) fail to call two\n\nwitnesses (Ms. Mercado and Ms. Dominguez).\n\n          The trial court viewed Castillo's performance-related\n\nallegations that counsel was ill-prepared and unqualified as \"mere\n\nMonday-morning quarterbacking.\" Commonwealth v. Castillo, No. 9477\n\nCR 3461, slip op. at 6.         The trial court found that Fernandez's\n\nperformance    was   not   \"measurably      below   that    of    an   ordinarily\n\nfallible lawyer.\"      Id. at 5.     The court cited as evidence of the\n\nadequacy of her performance Fernandez's appropriate presentation of\n\na number of pretrial motions, her effective cross-examination of\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fthe prosecution's witnesses, and a well-argued motion for a finding\n\nof not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth's case as well as at\n\nthe end of trial.        The court's evaluation of counsel's performance\n\nfrom its contemporaneous perspective during trial is an appropriate\n\napplication of Strickland's caution against the \"distorting effects\n\nof hindsight.\"        Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\n               The trial court deemed Fernandez's decision not to call\n\nMs. Mercado and Ms. Dominguez \"a strategic decision which the court\n\nwill   not     second    guess\"   and   \"well   within   the   wide   range   of\n\nreasonable professional assistance.\"             These witnesses could not\n\noffer testimony on the critical issue of what transpired within the\n\napartment but could only corroborate Castillo's history and stated\n\nreasons for being in        Massachusetts.      Moreover, there were details\n\nof their proposed testimony (such as their accounts of where he got\n\nthe $467 in cash) that conflicted with Castillo's testimony.                  The\n\ntrial court's determination that the decision not to call them to\n\nthe    stand    was     reasonable   was   an   appropriate    application     of\n\nStrickland's insistence on the \"wide latitude counsel must have in\n\nmaking    tactical       decisions.\"       Strickland,   466   U.S.   at   689.\n\nSimilarly, the court viewed Fernandez's rejection of             instructions\n\non lesser offenses offered by the judge to be consistent with\n\ncounsel's not-manifestly-unreasonable theory that Castillo had no\n\nknowledge of any drugs in the apartment.              This determination is\n\nconsistent with the acknowledgment in Strickland that \"[t]here are\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fcountless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case,\"\n\nand that there is a \"presumption that, under the circumstances, the\n\nchallenged    action    might   be   considered    sound    trial   strategy.\"\n\nStrickland 466 U.S. at 689 (internal quotations omitted).\n\n          The most troubling of Fernandez's alleged errors is her\n\nstipulation to the quantity of drugs found in the apartment.                By\n\nstipulating to 200 grams, Fernandez not only ensured that, if found\n\nguilty, Castillo would be sentenced to a minimum of fifteen years,\n\nbut she also established as proven a fact from which the jury could\n\ndraw the reasonable inference of intent to distribute.               The trial\n\ncourt found this decision not to contest the quantity of drugs to\n\nbe consistent with counsel's theory that Castillo did not know\n\nanything about the drugs present in the apartment, a theory of the\n\ncase   that    the     trial    court   concluded     was    not    manifestly\n\nunreasonable.\n\n             We acknowledge that Fernandez's decision to stipulate to\n\nthe presence of the 200 grams or more of cocaine seems, from\n\nhindsight,     somewhat   puzzling.         She   could    have    concurrently\n\nmaintained the theory that Castillo did not know about the drugs\n\nwhile requiring the Commonwealth to meet its burden of proof as to\n\nthe quantity of cocaine found in the apartment.              She received no\n\napparent advantage from this concession.            On the other hand, with\n\n169 grams of cocaine found in the clear plastic bags thrown out the\n\nwindow, and several additional bags of cocaine in the brown paper\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fbag on the table where Castillo was standing (along with the\n\ncocaine the jury might have assumed was flushed down the toilet),\n\nproof of the 200 gram minimum, in the absence of the stipulation,\n\nwould probably not have taxed the prosecution greatly.                       Defense\n\ncounsel might well have reasoned that a refusal to stipulate would\n\nonly draw attention to the various quantities of drugs in the\n\nimmediate area and thereby hurt, not help, her client.\n\n             In any event, given the consistency of this stipulation\n\nwith Castillo's defense (an unawareness of the presence of drugs in\n\nthe apartment), we can not say that the trial court's determination\n\nthat this defense strategy \"was not manifestly unreasonable\" (and\n\ntherefore did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel)\n\nrises to the level of \"unreasonableness\" required by the AEDPA\n\nstatute.     Indeed, in light of Strickland's\n\nimplicit endorsement of the Fifth Circuit's \"patently unreasonable\"\n\napproach to the analysis of decision-making and its presumption\n\nthat   the   challenged        action   \"might    be    considered       sound   trial\n\nstrategy,\"    Strickland,        466    U.S.     at    689,   the   conclusion     is\n\ninescapable     that     the    trial    court's       rejection    of    Castillo's\n\nineffective assistance claim does not constitute an unreasonable\n\napplication of clearly established federal law.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\f",

In pursuing a new trial, petitioner argued that (1) the trial court's denial of defense counsel's motion for a continuance at the beginning of the trial was \"so arbitrary as to violate due process,\" and (2) defense counsel's subsequent conduct at trial violated the petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In asserting those arguments here, petitioner contends that the state courts' denial of his motion for a new trial was contrary to, and an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Unpersuaded, we affirm the decision of the district court denying the petition for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 1996, petitioner, Juan Castillo (\"Castillo\"), was convicted by a jury in the Massachusetts Superior Court of trafficking in a controlled substance (cocaine), and was sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years. Castillo appealed his conviction to the Massachusetts Appeals Court. On April 15, 1998, Castillo filed a motion in the Superior Court for a new trial arguing that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in denying defense counsel Christine Fernandez (\"Fernandez\") a continuance, and (2) that Fernandez's lack of knowledge of the law, failure to interview or prepare Castillo, mischaracterization of Castillo's testimony in closing argument, and failure to call relevant witnesses was ineffective assistance of counsel under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Sixth Amendment. By an order entered June 15, 1998, the trial judge denied the motion without discovery or an evidentiary hearing, finding that no continuance was necessary because the filing of counsel's appearance was a representation that she was \"ready, willing, and able\" to try the case, and that her performance was not ineffective. <i>Commonwealth v. Castillo,</i> No. 9477 CR 3461 (Mass. Superior Ct. June 15, 1998) (order denying defendant's motion for new trial). Castillo's appeal from this order was consolidated with his direct appeal. On June 8, 1999, the Appeals Court summarily affirmed Castillo's conviction and the denial of his new trial motion \"substantially for those reasons set out in the trial judge's memorandum of decision.\" <i>Commonwealth v. Castillo,</i> 47 Mass.App.Ct. 1103, 711 N.E.2d 618 (1999)(mem. &amp; order affirming defendant's conviction and denial of motion for a new trial). The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts denied further appellate review. <i>Commonwealth v.

On March 22, 2001, the district court referred the petition to a United States magistrate judge for a recommended disposition. On July 6, 2001, the magistrate judge issued a thorough Report and Recommendation recommending that the petition be dismissed. On July 17, Castillo timely objected to three factual determinations contained in the report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> By an order dated July 27, 2001, the district court rejected Castillo's objections and adopted the report in its entirety.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On August 1, 2002, the district court explained its decision to grant Castillo a certificate of appealability. \"While a strong case has been made that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness because of her utter lack of preparation, I agreed (and still agree) with the magistrate judge that petitioner has not shown that prejudice resulted. Nonetheless, habeas appellate counsel has valiantly made enough of a showing to persuade me that an appeal is appropriate.\" <i>Castillo v.

The Offense and Some Pretrial History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about 8 p.m. on October 30, 1994, two police officers for the city of Lynn received a radio report of a disturbance at 102 Cottage Street. Upon arrival, the residents of the first floor apartment let the officers into the three-unit building and directed them upstairs. The officers proceeded to the second floor, which was empty and unlit, where they heard footsteps coming from the third floor. Officer Griffin proceeded to the third floor apartment and knocked on the door, identifying himself as \"policia.\" Officer Hogan went up the back stairs to the third floor, where he heard the back door unlock and saw Castillo begin to emerge from the doorway. Castillo then turned and went back into the apartment. Officer Hogan entered through the back door, saw a second man in the apartment's bathroom holding a plastic bag containing a white substance, and heard the toilet flushing. The officer then saw a third man in the kitchen making a throwing gesture towards the window. On the ground beneath the kitchen window, the police later recovered two clear plastic bags containing approximately 169 grams of cocaine. Castillo and a fourth man were standing next to the kitchen table, on which Officer Hogan observed a partially open brown paper bag containing several plastic sandwich bags filled with a white powder, and two digital scales. Castillo was never seen in physical custody of any controlled substance. The officers arrested Castillo and brought him to the police station, where officers found a beeper and $467 in cash on his person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 14, 1994, a Massachusetts grand jury indicted Castillo for trafficking in 200 grams or more of cocaine, and conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94c, &#167;&#167; 32E, 40 (2003). At Castillo's arraignment on January 11, 1995, attorney Kirk Bransfield was appointed to represent him. After deciding a variety of pretrial motions and after a number of continuances, the trial court scheduled the beginning of trial for December 13, 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Castillo failed to appear on December 13, and an arrest warrant issued. Approximately six months later, Castillo was arrested at a New York airport and remanded to Massachusetts for trial. Trial was scheduled to begin on September 23, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Attorney Fernandez's Appearance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 5, 1996, Christine Fernandez, an attorney with the New York law firm of Aranda &amp; Guttlein, filed a motion to appear pro hac vice in this matter. On the same day, attorney Andres M. Aranda, a partner of the Aranda &amp; Guttlein law firm, also moved to appear pro hac vice but his motion was not docketed or acted upon by the court. In an affidavit filed in support of her motion, Fernandez stated that she had been a member in good standing of the New York bar since 1996 and that she \"specialize[d] in criminal and federal law.\" On September 9, Fernandez appeared in person before a Superior Court judge, who allowed the motion to appear pro hac vice on the express \"condition that the trial date of September 23, 1996 remain the scheduled trial date and that the allowance of this motion not delay the trial.\" On that same day, Fernandez filed a notice of appearance, and attorney Bransfield, the court-appointed counsel, withdrew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 1996, attorney Jorge Guttlein (\"Guttlein\"), another partner of the Aranda &amp; Guttlein law firm, sent a letter to the court together with an undated motion to appear pro hac vice. In the letter, Guttlein acknowledged that Castillo's trial was scheduled for September 23, 1996, but requested that trial be continued until October 17 because he had a scheduling conflict. The trial court treated this letter as a motion for a continuance, which it denied. Castillo's case was subsequently transferred from Essex Superior Court to Lawrence Superior Court for trial on September 24, 1996. Guttlein appeared before the Lawrence Superior Court on September 24, 1996, and his motion to appear pro hac vice was allowed that day. Castillo's case was not called for trial that day but was continued to the next morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez appeared in court the next morning and informed the judge that Guttlein had been \"called back to New York late yesterday afternoon because his wife was ill.\" Fernandez stated that she was appearing on Castillo's behalf and that she had reviewed all the pretrial motions and was prepared to argue them, but that she had a \"series of requests\" regarding her \"late entry into the case this morning.\" She sought a further delay in the trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I arrived in Massachusetts last night at about four a.m. because the roads were awful with the rain and everything else. I have had very little opportunity to review this file. I understand that we're scheduled to go forward, and I'm prepared to at least go forward with jury selection. However, I would ask your Honor please not to go forward with any testimony until I've had an opportunity to further review this file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge responded that Fernandez's motion to appear was allowed several weeks ago \"with the specific condition that it not delay the trial.\" Fernandez argued that at the time she was admitted to appear pro hac vice, she \"was not under the impression that [she] would be trying this case\" since Guttlein has been \"slotted to try this case.\" The judge replied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Y]our firm was on notice that whoever was going to try this case was going to be prepared for it. And the Court doesn't look behind appearances when you have two or three people, all of whom are on there. Everyone is presumed to be ready, willing and able to try the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the judge stated that he did not know how far they would get that day, although it seemed likely they would get through impanelment and opening statements. He deferred ruling on the request to delay any testimony until later in the day. After impanelment and opening statements, the judge recessed the proceedings for an hour and a half, stating that the Commonwealth would call its first witness following the recess and Fernandez would be called on to cross-examine the witness. Although this statement implicitly denied the request for a one-day delay of testimony, Fernandez did not voice any further objections to the schedule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Castillo's Trial Strategy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Castillo was charged with trafficking in a controlled substance, an offense with the following elements: (1) knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance, (2) with the specific intent to distribute the controlled substance, and (3) if the controlled substance is cocaine (as defined in Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. ch. 94C &#167; 31), the controlled substance has a net weight of fourteen grams or more. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94c, &#167; 32E(b). The statute sets out escalating penalties for amounts in excess of the fourteen grams necessary for conviction. Specifically, the statute sets a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for 28 grams or more but less than 100 grams, and a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years for 200 grams or more. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94c, &#167; 32E(2), (4). Two lesser included offenses of trafficking are possession with intent to distribute and simple possession. To gain a trafficking conviction rather than the lesser offense of possession with intent to distribute, the prosecution must establish possession with intent to distribute a minimum weight of fourteen grams of cocaine. Simple possession is merely knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance &#8212; there is no \"intent to distribute\" or minimum weight requirement. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94c, &#167; 34. The sentence for simple possession is imprisonment for not more than one year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Castillo's trial strategy was to win a not guilty verdict by defeating the prosecution's proof of the first element of the trafficking offense: knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance. Thus, attorney Fernandez did not contest that the substance in question found at the apartment was cocaine and that the amount of the substance was 200 grams or more. Instead, she argued that Castillo did not know there were any drugs in the apartment or that the other people in the apartment were engaged in drug dealing. Castillo was merely present in someone else's apartment where drugs happened to be found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth opened its case by calling Officer Hogan to the stand, who testified to the activities he witnessed in the apartment. In accordance with her trial strategy, Fernandez established through her cross-examination of Officer Hogan that he did not see Castillo handle any of the drugs and that in order to be able to see the drugs inside the bag on the kitchen table, a person had to be standing over the bag. She further established that if Castillo had been sitting at the kitchen table he would not have been able to see into the bag that was on the table.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following morning, the Commonwealth called Officer Griffin, who testified in a manner similar to Officer Hogan about the events leading to Castillo's arrest and added that at the police station a beeper and $467 in cash were recovered from Castillo's person. On cross-examination, Fernandez established that not all beepers are used to conduct drug transactions and that no drugs were ever found in Castillo's possession. The Commonwealth also called Lieutenant Stevens who testified generally about the drug trade in Lynn at the time of Castillo's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth's case, Fernandez moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the Commonwealth's evidence established only Castillo's \"mere presence in an apartment where narcotics\" were seized and that this was insufficient to establish guilt under Massachusetts law. The judge denied the motion. Fernandez then called Castillo to the stand to explain the circumstances of his presence in Lynn and to offer his account of what transpired on the night of his arrest. Castillo testified that he was a resident of the Bronx, New York, where he lived with his wife and daughter. He worked in Manhattan delivering clothes for a weekly income of $260 to $280. He had come to Lynn to help his former mother-in-law locate his missing son, and the cash he brought with him was to buy clothes and gifts for his son. While in Lynn he met Rodriguez, a resident of the apartment, at a \"telephone place\" (a business providing inexpensive long distance telephone service as an alternative to pay phones), where they spoke on several occasions. On October 30, 1994, Rodriguez invited Castillo to his apartment at 102 Cottage Street. After being at the apartment for ten or fifteen minutes, Castillo testified that he got up to leave and was confronted by a police officer as he attempted to exit the back door. Castillo denied having any knowledge of any drugs in the apartment prior to the arrival of the police officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the examination of witnesses, the Court reviewed the jury charge.

On the grounds pertinent to this case, a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner if it finds, <i>inter alia,</i> that the state court adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law....\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1). This section \"defines two categories of cases in which a state prisoner may obtain federal habeas relief with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 404, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Under the \"contrary to\" prong, a federal court may grant the writ if the state court \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Under the \"unreasonable application\" prong, a federal court may grant the writ if the state court \"identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495. In the latter case, the state court's determination must be unreasonable, not simply incorrect, and unreasonableness is an objective standard. <i>Id.</i> at 410-11, 120 S.Ct. 1495. \"If it is a close question whether the state decision is in error, then the state decision cannot be an unreasonable application.\" <i>McCambridge v.

Sarafite,</i> 376 U.S. 575, 84 S.Ct. 841, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964). The Supreme Court held that a trial judge's decision not to grant the defendant in a contempt hearing a one-week continuance did not offend the requirements of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The matter of continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge, and it is not every denial of a request for more time that violates due process even if the party fails to offer evidence or is compelled to defend without counsel. Contrariwise, a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted).

In its denial of Castillo's motion for a new trial, the trial court noted that the trial originally had been scheduled for September 23, 1996, that Fernandez had presented a motion to appear pro hac vice and had made a corresponding appearance almost two months before the scheduled trial date, and that, in allowing the motion, the court put Fernandez on notice that the impending trial would not be delayed. Thus, counsel had ample time to prepare. Even in pressing her last minute request for a brief continuance, Fernandez made no representations to the trial judge that she had never before tried a case and that her inexperience might make it difficult for her to try this case under the circumstances. Furthermore, in its order denying Castillo's motion for a new trial, the trial court found that \"counsel's performance during the trial did not reflect that of an attorney noticeably lacking in either experience or competence sufficient to meet constitutional standards.\" <i>Commonwealth v. Castillo,</i> No. 9477 CR 3461, slip op. at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In submitting her motion to appear, Fernandez represented to the court that she was ready to try the case. Moreover, that motion was allowed on the express condition that the trial date remain as scheduled and the trial not be delayed. At no time did Fernandez indicate to the judge that this was her first trial. To the contrary, in her motion to appear, Fernandez explicitly stated \"I specialize in Criminal and Federal law.\" In light of the information before the trial judge at the time he made his decision and the \"great deal of latitude\" necessarily afforded judges in scheduling trials, <i>Morris,</i> 461 U.S. at 11, 103 S.Ct. 1610, the decision not to grant Castillo a new trial on the basis of the denial of his request for a continuance was not an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting Castillo's motion for a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court found that \"Attorney Fernandez's performance [was not] measurably below that of an ordinarily fallible lawyer\" and \"defense counsel's theory of the case was not `manifestly unreasonable.'\" <i>Commonwealth v. Castillo,</i> No. 9477 CR 3461, slip op. at 5-6. Castillo argues that the \"manifestly unreasonable\" standard that the trial court applied in assessing trial counsel's tactical judgment is contrary to the standard the Supreme Court prescribed in <i>Strickland.</i> Castillo also argues that the state court's evaluation of Fernandez's performance was an unreasonable application of <i>Strickland.</i> After a brief explanation of the <i>Strickland</i> standard, we explain our reasons for rejecting these arguments on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The <i>Strickland</i> Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> the Supreme Court set forth the controlling principles for deciding ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Under these principles, a defendant alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must establish two elements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \"counsel\" guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In addressing the first element, \"judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential.\" <i>Id.</i> at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A reviewing court must leave \"ample room for variations in professional judgment,\" <i>Ouber v. Guarino,</i> 293 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052), and \"every effort [must] be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Only if, \"in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions of counsel were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\" can a finding of deficient performance ensue. <i>Id.</i> at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if counsel's performance is constitutionally deficient, the second element of the <i>Strickland</i> standard requires the petitioner to demonstrate that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Id.</i> at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. While such prejudice may be presumed in a few limited circumstances, such cases are the exception. <i>See Bell v. Cone,</i> 535 U.S. 685, 695-96, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). Generally, the petitioner \"must carry the devoir of persuasion and prove that he was prejudiced, i.e. that his attorney's parlous conduct may have altered the outcome of the case.\" <i>Ouber,</i> 293 F.3d at 25. However, \"there is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in [] order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Hence we address primarily the performance component of the <i>Strickland</i> standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Contrary to <i>Strickland</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating Castillo's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the state court used the following standard:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Castillo] must demonstrate that defense counsel's performance fell \"measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\" and that such inadequacies likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available defense. <i>Commonwealth v. Saferian,</i> 366 Mass. 89, 96, 315 N.E.2d 878 (1974). Counsel's tactical judgment must be \"manifestly unreasonable\" to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <i>Commonwealth v. White,</i> 409 Mass. 266, 273, 565 N.E.2d 1185 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Commonwealth v. Castillo,</i> No. 9477 CR 3461, slip op. at 5-6. In his brief on appeal Castillo argues that this \"manifestly unreasonable\" standard is contrary to the federal standard set forth in <i>Strickland.</i> Ordinarily, we would not address this argument, as it was not raised before the district court in either Castillo's original habeas petition or in his application for a certificate of appealability. <i>Malave v. Carney Hosp.,</i> 170 F.3d 217, 222 (1st Cir.1999) (\"It is a bedrock rule of appellate practice that... matters not raised in the [district] court cannot be hawked for the first time on appeal.\"); <i>see Kramer v. Kemna,</i> 21 F.3d 305, 308 (8th Cir.1994) (In an appeal from a denial of a writ of habeas corpus, the court declined to consider issues not raised before the district court, holding that the \"[f]ailure to give the district court a first opportunity to decide the merits of an argument constitutes a waiver of that argument.\"); <i>Yohey v. Collins,</i> 985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (same); <i>Depree v. Thomas,</i> 946 F.2d 784, 793 (11th Cir.1991) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, an appellate court has discretion, in an exceptional case, to reach issues that were not raised below. <i>United States v. La Guardia,</i> 902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir.1990); <i>United States v. Krynicki,</i> 689 F.2d 289, 291-92 (1st Cir.1982). We have found the exercise of such discretion to be appropriate where the appellant's challenge \"raises an issue of constitutional magnitude which, if meritorious, could substantially affect [the appellant], and future defendants....\" <i>La Guardia,</i> 902 F.2d at 1013; <i>see TI Federal Credit Union v. DelBonis,</i> 72 F.3d 921, 930 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[C]ases involving important constitutional or governmental issues may be exceptional and, as such, there should be a full treatment of all legal issues involved, whether squarely introduced by the parties or not.\"). Castillo's argument that the state court's \"manifestly unreasonable\" standard is contrary to <i>Strickland</i> raises an important question of law that can be resolved on the existing record and that is \"almost certain to be presented in identical terms in other cases.\" <i>La Guardia,</i> 902 F.2d at 1013. The issue has been fully briefed on this appeal and was covered exhaustively at oral argument. If this constitutional claim were otherwise meritorious, failure to reach it because of a procedural default could result in \"a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>See id.</i> Therefore, we address the merits of Castillo's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating whether Castillo was denied effective assistance of counsel, the trial court differentiated between allegations concerning the quality of counsel's performance and those concerning the reasonableness of her tactical judgments. <i>Commonwealth v. Castillo,</i> No. 9477 CR 3461, slip op. at 5-6. The trial court cited <i>Commonwealth v. Saferian,</i> 366 Mass. 89, 315 N.E.2d 878, 883 (1974), for the proposition that Castillo was required to demonstrate that attorney Fernandez's performance fell \"measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\" It concluded that Castillo failed to meet this burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Castillo does not contest the trial court's use of the performance standard articulated by the Massachusetts Supreme Court in <i>Saferian,</i> which we have described as the \"functional equivalent of <i>Strickland.\" Ouber v. Guarino,</i> 293 F.3d 19, 31 (1st Cir.2002). Rather, Castillo argues that the trial court applied to counsel's tactical judgments a standard that was \"contrary to\" <i>Strickland.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> For the reasons set forth below, we are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its use of the phrase \"manifestly unreasonable,\" the trial court cited <i>Commonwealth v. White,</i> 409 Mass. 266, 565 N.E.2d 1185, 1189-90 (1991), which in turn cited <i>Commonwealth v. Adams,</i> 374 Mass. 722, 375 N.E.2d 681, 685 (1978) (\"Although most cases involving a claim of ineffective counsel concern counsel's lack of preparation, there may be instances where the judgment of fully informed counsel may be so manifestly unreasonable as to be unprotected by the labels of `trial strategy' or `trial tactics.'\"). In <i>White,</i> the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court quoted <i>Saferian's</i> standard for evaluating a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and then added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases where tactical or strategic decisions of defendant's counsel are at issue, we conduct our review with some deference to avoid characterizing as unreasonable a defense that was merely unsuccessful. <i>See Commonwealth v. Rondeau,</i> 378 Mass. 408, 413, 392 N.E.2d 1001 (1979). <i>See also Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 689-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Rather than merely unreasonable, we require that challenged tactical judgments must be \"manifestly unreasonable.\" <i>Commonwealth v. Adams,</i> 374 Mass. 722, 728, 375 N.E.2d 681 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>White,</i> 565 N.E.2d at 1190. Thus, in support of the \"manifestly unreasonable\" language, the trial court cited to <i>White,</i> which relied heavily on both <i>Saferian</i> and <i>Strickland.</i> This \"manifestly unreasonable\" standard is not contrary to the standard set forth in <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Strickland,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"the proper standard for attorney performance is that of reasonably effective assistance,\" and that \"[w]hen a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel's assistance, the defendant must show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \"More specific guidelines are not appropriate.... The proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\" <i>Id.</i> at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Recently, in <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> Justice O'Connor clarified what it means for a state court decision to be contrary to clearly established federal law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"contrary\" is commonly understood to mean \"diametrically different,\" \"opposite in character or nature,\" or \"mutually opposed.\" The text of &#167; 2254(d)(1) therefore suggests that the state court's decision must be substantially different from the relevant precedent of this Court.... Take, for example, our decision in <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). If a state court were to reject a prisoner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the grounds that the prisoner had not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the result of his criminal proceeding would have been different, that decision would be \"diametrically different,\" \"opposite in character or nature,\" and \"mutually opposed\" to our clearly established precedent because we held in <i>Strickland</i> that the prisoner need only demonstrate a \"reasonable probability that ... the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Id.</i> at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). By this example, a state court decision imposing a heavier burden on a defendant endeavoring to make an ineffective assistance claim than that set forth in <i>Strickland</i> is contrary to <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, <i>Strickland</i> also counsels that in evaluating the reasonableness of counsel's tactical or strategic choices, courts must apply \"a heavy measure of deference to counsel's judgments.\" In this context, \"the Supreme Court [in <i>Strickland</i>] cited with approval the approach to strategic decision-making of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which allowed challenges when `the choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it.'\" <i>Phoenix v. Matesanz,</i> 233 F.3d 77, 82 n. 2 (1st Cir.2000)(quoting <i>Washington v. Strickland,</i> 693 F.2d 1243, 1254 (5th Cir.1982)). In addition to the First and Fifth Circuits, other circuits have applied this \"patently unreasonable\" formulation to tactical judgments. <i>See, e.g., Bullock v. Carver,</i> 297 F.3d 1036, 1046 (10th Cir.2002); <i>Dorsey v. Chapman,</i> 262 F.3d 1181, 1186 (11th Cir.2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> 535 U.S. 1000, 122 S.Ct. 1567, 152 L.Ed.2d 489 (2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The minor variation in phraseology between \"patently\" and \"manifestly\" does not render the Massachusetts standard contrary to federal law. <i>See Ouber,</i> 293 F.3d at 32. As the Supreme Court in <i>Strickland</i> implicitly affirmed the lower court's \"patently unreasonable\" formulation in the context of tactical decision-making, the standard employed by the trial court in evaluating Castillo's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not \"diametrically different,\" \"opposite in character or nature,\" or \"mutually opposed\" to <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Unreasonable Application of <i>Strickland</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his habeas petition to the district court, and now on appeal, Castillo argues that the trial court's resolution of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. Castillo's complaints fall into two broad categories. Under the first, Castillo alleges that Fernandez's failure to know the law resulted in the following errors: (1) stipulating that the substance found in the apartment was cocaine and that the total amount of cocaine exceeded 200 grams; (2) rejecting jury instructions on the lesser included offenses of simple possession and possession with intent to distribute; and (3) requesting a harmful joint venture jury instruction. Under the second, Castillo alleges that Fernandez's failure to know the facts caused her to (1) call Castillo to the stand after inadequate preparation; and (2) fail to call two witnesses (Ms. Mercado and Ms. Dominguez).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court viewed Castillo's performance-related allegations that counsel was ill-prepared and unqualified as \"mere Monday-morning quarterbacking.\" <i>Commonwealth v. Castillo,</i> No. 9477 CR 3461, slip op. at 6. The trial court found that Fernandez's performance was not \"measurably below that of an ordinarily fallible lawyer.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5. The court cited as evidence of the adequacy of her performance Fernandez's appropriate presentation of a number of pretrial motions, her effective cross-examination of the prosecution's witnesses, and a well-argued motion for a finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth's case as well as at the end of trial. The court's evaluation of counsel's performance from its contemporaneous perspective during trial is an appropriate application of <i>Strickland's</i> caution against the \"distorting effects of hindsight.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court deemed Fernandez's decision not to call Ms. Mercado and Ms. Dominguez \"a strategic decision which the court will not second guess\" and \"well within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\" These witnesses could not offer testimony on the critical issue of what transpired within the apartment but could only corroborate Castillo's history and stated reasons for being in Massachusetts. Moreover, there were details of their proposed testimony (such as their accounts of where he got the $467 in cash) that conflicted with Castillo's testimony. The trial court's determination that the decision not to call them to the stand was reasonable was an appropriate application of <i>Strickland's</i> insistence on the \"wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Similarly, the court viewed Fernandez's rejection of instructions on lesser offenses offered by the judge to be consistent with counsel's not-manifestly-unreasonable theory that Castillo had no knowledge of any drugs in the apartment. This determination is consistent with the acknowledgment in <i>Strickland</i> that \"[t]here are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case,\" and that there is a \"presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\" <i>Strickland</i> 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most troubling of Fernandez's alleged errors is her stipulation to the quantity of drugs found in the apartment. By stipulating to 200 grams, Fernandez not only ensured that, if found guilty, Castillo would be sentenced to a minimum of fifteen years, but she also established as proven a fact from which the jury could draw the reasonable inference of intent to distribute. The trial court found this decision not to contest the quantity of drugs to be consistent with counsel's theory that Castillo did not know anything about the drugs present in the apartment, a theory of the case that the trial court concluded was not manifestly unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that Fernandez's decision to stipulate to the presence of the 200 grams or more of cocaine seems, from hindsight, somewhat puzzling. She could have concurrently maintained the theory that Castillo did not know about the drugs while requiring the Commonwealth to meet its burden of proof as to the quantity of cocaine found in the apartment. She received no apparent advantage from this concession. On the other hand, with 169 grams of cocaine found in the clear plastic bags thrown out the window, and several additional bags of cocaine in the brown paper bag on the table where Castillo was standing (along with the cocaine the jury might have assumed was flushed down the toilet), proof of the 200 gram minimum, in the absence of the stipulation, would probably not have taxed the prosecution greatly. Defense counsel might well have reasoned that a refusal to stipulate would only draw attention to the various quantities of drugs in the immediate area and thereby hurt, not help, her client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, given the consistency of this stipulation with Castillo's defense (an unawareness of the presence of drugs in the apartment), we can not say that the trial court's determination that this defense strategy \"was not manifestly unreasonable\" (and therefore did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel) rises to the level of \"unreasonableness\" required by the AEDPA statute. Indeed, in light of <i>Strickland's</i> implicit endorsement of the Fifth Circuit's \"patently unreasonable\" approach to the analysis of decision-making and its presumption that the challenged action \"might be considered sound trial strategy,\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, the conclusion is inescapable that the trial court's rejection of Castillo's ineffective assistance claim does not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge contained a clear notice that \"any party who objects to these proposed findings and recommendations must file a written objection thereto ... within 10 days....

July 6, 2001) (Report and Recommendation of United States magistrate judge). Despite this clear warning, Castillo made limited objections to the magistrate judge's report. Respondent rightly argues that \"none of the proposed factual findings [to which petitioner objected], even if erroneous, provides a basis for habeas relief. The remaining aspects of petitioner's appeal comprise matters to which no objection was made and, therefore, are waived and not properly before this Court.\" In most circumstances we would enforce this important rule of waiver. <i>See Keating v. Sec'y of Health and Human Servs.,</i> 848 F.2d 271 (1st Cir.1988) (\"[O]nly those issues fairly raised by the objections to the magistrate's report are subject to review in the district court and those not preserved by such objection are precluded on appeal.\").

Strictly applied here, this rule would mean that we would not be addressing the merits of any of Castillo's arguments on appeal, and there might be further claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in these post-conviction proceedings.

This is incorrect. The court applied the \"manifestly unreasonable\" standard to actions that it characterized as tactical or strategic. It applied a different test to Castillo's claims relating to trial counsel's inadequate preparation, qualifications to conduct the trial, and performance at the trial, concluding that \"Attorney Fernandez's performance [was not] measurably below that of an ordinarily fallible lawyer.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In citing with approval the Fifth Circuit's approach, the Supreme Court in<i>Strickland</i> noted that \"strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable,\" while \"strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Thus, rather than simply characterizing trial counsel's tactical decisions as \"unconsidered blunders,\" Castillo might have argued that the trial court erred by failing to distinguish between informed and uninformed tactical decision-making. However, those Circuits that have adopted the \"patently unreasonable\" formulation are divided on the question of whether <i>Strickland</i> accords heightened deference only to informed strategic choices. <i>See Epsom v. Hall,</i> 330 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir.2003) (applying the formulation to all strategic decision-making); <i>Dorsey,</i> 262 F.3d at 1186 (same); <i>cf. Bullock v. Carver,</i> 297 F.3d at 1046 (applying the standard to counsel's \"fully-informed strategic choices\"). Therefore, even if Castillo had raised this argument directly, we would be unable to conclude that the state court's application of the \"manifestly unreasonable\" formula to all tactical judgments was contrary to <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In pursuing a new trial, petitioner argued that (1) the trial court's denial of defense counsel's motion for a continuance at the beginning of the trial was \"so arbitrary as to violate due process,\" and (2) defense counsel's subsequent conduct at trial violated the petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In asserting those arguments here, petitioner contends that the state courts' denial of his motion for a new trial was contrary to, and an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Unpersuaded, we affirm the decision of the district court denying the petition for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 1996, petitioner, Juan Castillo (\"Castillo\"), was convicted by a jury in the Massachusetts Superior Court of trafficking in a controlled substance (cocaine), and was sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years. Castillo appealed his conviction to the Massachusetts Appeals Court. On April 15, 1998, Castillo filed a motion in the Superior Court for a new trial arguing that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in denying defense counsel Christine Fernandez (\"Fernandez\") a continuance, and (2) that Fernandez's lack of knowledge of the law, failure to interview or prepare Castillo, mischaracterization of Castillo's testimony in closing argument, and failure to call relevant witnesses was ineffective assistance of counsel under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Sixth Amendment. By an order entered June 15, 1998, the trial judge denied the motion without discovery or an evidentiary hearing, finding that no continuance was necessary because the filing of counsel's appearance was a representation that she was \"ready, willing, and able\" to try the case, and that her performance was not ineffective. <i>Commonwealth v. Castillo,</i> No. 9477 CR 3461 (Mass. Superior Ct. June 15, 1998) (order denying defendant's motion for new trial). Castillo's appeal from this order was consolidated with his direct appeal.

On March 22, 2001, the district court referred the petition to a United States magistrate judge for a recommended disposition. On July 6, 2001, the magistrate judge issued a thorough Report and Recommendation recommending that the petition be dismissed. On July 17, Castillo timely objected to three factual determinations contained in the report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> By an order dated July 27, 2001, the district court rejected Castillo's objections and adopted the report in its entirety.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On August 1, 2002, the district court explained its decision to grant Castillo a certificate of appealability. \"While a strong case has been made that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness because of her utter lack of preparation, I agreed (and still agree) with the magistrate judge that petitioner has not shown that prejudice resulted.

Upon arrival, the residents of the first floor apartment let the officers into the three-unit building and directed them upstairs. The officers proceeded to the second floor, which was empty and unlit, where they heard footsteps coming from the third floor. Officer Griffin proceeded to the third floor apartment and knocked on the door, identifying himself as \"policia.\" Officer Hogan went up the back stairs to the third floor, where he heard the back door unlock and saw Castillo begin to emerge from the doorway. Castillo then turned and went back into the apartment. Officer Hogan entered through the back door, saw a second man in the apartment's bathroom holding a plastic bag containing a white substance, and heard the toilet flushing. The officer then saw a third man in the kitchen making a throwing gesture towards the window. On the ground beneath the kitchen window, the police later recovered two clear plastic bags containing approximately 169 grams of cocaine. Castillo and a fourth man were standing next to the kitchen table, on which Officer Hogan observed a partially open brown paper bag containing several plastic sandwich bags filled with a white powder, and two digital scales. Castillo was never seen in physical custody of any controlled substance. The officers arrested Castillo and brought him to the police station, where officers found a beeper and $467 in cash on his person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 14, 1994, a Massachusetts grand jury indicted Castillo for trafficking in 200 grams or more of cocaine, and conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94c, &#167;&#167; 32E, 40 (2003). At Castillo's arraignment on January 11, 1995, attorney Kirk Bransfield was appointed to represent him. After deciding a variety of pretrial motions and after a number of continuances, the trial court scheduled the beginning of trial for December 13, 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Castillo failed to appear on December 13, and an arrest warrant issued. Approximately six months later, Castillo was arrested at a New York airport and remanded to Massachusetts for trial. Trial was scheduled to begin on September 23, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Attorney Fernandez's Appearance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 5, 1996, Christine Fernandez, an attorney with the New York law firm of Aranda &amp; Guttlein, filed a motion to appear pro hac vice in this matter. On the same day, attorney Andres M. Aranda, a partner of the Aranda &amp; Guttlein law firm, also moved to appear pro hac vice but his motion was not docketed or acted upon by the court. In an affidavit filed in support of her motion, Fernandez stated that she had been a member in good standing of the New York bar since 1996 and that she \"specialize[d] in criminal and federal law.\" On September 9, Fernandez appeared in person before a Superior Court judge, who allowed the motion to appear pro hac vice on the express \"condition that the trial date of September 23, 1996 remain the scheduled trial date and that the allowance of this motion not delay the trial.\" On that same day, Fernandez filed a notice of appearance, and attorney Bransfield, the court-appointed counsel, withdrew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 1996, attorney Jorge Guttlein (\"Guttlein\"), another partner of the Aranda &amp; Guttlein law firm, sent a letter to the court together with an undated motion to appear pro hac vice. In the letter, Guttlein acknowledged that Castillo's trial was scheduled for September 23, 1996, but requested that trial be continued until October 17 because he had a scheduling conflict. The trial court treated this letter as a motion for a continuance, which it denied. Castillo's case was subsequently transferred from Essex Superior Court to Lawrence Superior Court for trial on September 24, 1996. Guttlein appeared before the Lawrence Superior Court on September 24, 1996, and his motion to appear pro hac vice was allowed that day. Castillo's case was not called for trial that day but was continued to the next morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez appeared in court the next morning and informed the judge that Guttlein had been \"called back to New York late yesterday afternoon because his wife was ill.\" Fernandez stated that she was appearing on Castillo's behalf and that she had reviewed all the pretrial motions and was prepared to argue them, but that she had a \"series of requests\" regarding her \"late entry into the case this morning.\" She sought a further delay in the trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I arrived in Massachusetts last night at about four a.m. because the roads were awful with the rain and everything else. I have had very little opportunity to review this file. I understand that we're scheduled to go forward, and I'm prepared to at least go forward with jury selection. However, I would ask your Honor please not to go forward with any testimony until I've had an opportunity to further review this file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge responded that Fernandez's motion to appear was allowed several weeks ago \"with the specific condition that it not delay the trial.\" Fernandez argued that at the time she was admitted to appear pro hac vice, she \"was not under the impression that [she] would be trying this case\" since Guttlein has been \"slotted to try this case.\" The judge replied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Y]our firm was on notice that whoever was going to try this case was going to be prepared for it. And the Court doesn't look behind appearances when you have two or three people, all of whom are on there. Everyone is presumed to be ready, willing and able to try the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the judge stated that he did not know how far they would get that day, although it seemed likely they would get through impanelment and opening statements. He deferred ruling on the request to delay any testimony until later in the day. After impanelment and opening statements, the judge recessed the proceedings for an hour and a half, stating that the Commonwealth would call its first witness following the recess and Fernandez would be called on to cross-examine the witness. Although this statement implicitly denied the request for a one-day delay of testimony, Fernandez did not voice any further objections to the schedule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Castillo's Trial Strategy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Castillo was charged with trafficking in a controlled substance, an offense with the following elements: (1) knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance, (2) with the specific intent to distribute the controlled substance, and (3) if the controlled substance is cocaine (as defined in Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. ch. 94C &#167; 31), the controlled substance has a net weight of fourteen grams or more. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94c, &#167; 32E(b). The statute sets out escalating penalties for amounts in excess of the fourteen grams necessary for conviction. Specifically, the statute sets a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for 28 grams or more but less than 100 grams, and a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years for 200 grams or more. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94c, &#167; 32E(2), (4). Two lesser included offenses of trafficking are possession with intent to distribute and simple possession. To gain a trafficking conviction rather than the lesser offense of possession with intent to distribute, the prosecution must establish possession with intent to distribute a minimum weight of fourteen grams of cocaine. Simple possession is merely knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance &#8212; there is no \"intent to distribute\" or minimum weight requirement. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94c, &#167; 34. The sentence for simple possession is imprisonment for not more than one year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Castillo's trial strategy was to win a not guilty verdict by defeating the prosecution's proof of the first element of the trafficking offense: knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance. Thus, attorney Fernandez did not contest that the substance in question found at the apartment was cocaine and that the amount of the substance was 200 grams or more. Instead, she argued that Castillo did not know there were any drugs in the apartment or that the other people in the apartment were engaged in drug dealing. Castillo was merely present in someone else's apartment where drugs happened to be found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth opened its case by calling Officer Hogan to the stand, who testified to the activities he witnessed in the apartment. In accordance with her trial strategy, Fernandez established through her cross-examination of Officer Hogan that he did not see Castillo handle any of the drugs and that in order to be able to see the drugs inside the bag on the kitchen table, a person had to be standing over the bag. She further established that if Castillo had been sitting at the kitchen table he would not have been able to see into the bag that was on the table.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following morning, the Commonwealth called Officer Griffin, who testified in a manner similar to Officer Hogan about the events leading to Castillo's arrest and added that at the police station a beeper and $467 in cash were recovered from Castillo's person. On cross-examination, Fernandez established that not all beepers are used to conduct drug transactions and that no drugs were ever found in Castillo's possession. The Commonwealth also called Lieutenant Stevens who testified generally about the drug trade in Lynn at the time of Castillo's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth's case, Fernandez moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the Commonwealth's evidence established only Castillo's \"mere presence in an apartment where narcotics\" were seized and that this was insufficient to establish guilt under Massachusetts law. The judge denied the motion. Fernandez then called Castillo to the stand to explain the circumstances of his presence in Lynn and to offer his account of what transpired on the night of his arrest. Castillo testified that he was a resident of the Bronx, New York, where he lived with his wife and daughter. He worked in Manhattan delivering clothes for a weekly income of $260 to $280. He had come to Lynn to help his former mother-in-law locate his missing son, and the cash he brought with him was to buy clothes and gifts for his son. While in Lynn he met Rodriguez, a resident of the apartment, at a \"telephone place\" (a business providing inexpensive long distance telephone service as an alternative to pay phones), where they spoke on several occasions. On October 30, 1994, Rodriguez invited Castillo to his apartment at 102 Cottage Street. After being at the apartment for ten or fifteen minutes, Castillo testified that he got up to leave and was confronted by a police officer as he attempted to exit the back door.

In its denial of Castillo's motion for a new trial, the trial court noted that the trial originally had been scheduled for September 23, 1996, that Fernandez had presented a motion to appear pro hac vice and had made a corresponding appearance almost two months before the scheduled trial date, and that, in allowing the motion, the court put Fernandez on notice that the impending trial would not be delayed. Thus, counsel had ample time to prepare. Even in pressing her last minute request for a brief continuance, Fernandez made no representations to the trial judge that she had never before tried a case and that her inexperience might make it difficult for her to try this case under the circumstances. Furthermore, in its order denying Castillo's motion for a new trial, the trial court found that \"counsel's performance during the trial did not reflect that of an attorney noticeably lacking in either experience or competence sufficient to meet constitutional standards.\" <i>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, that motion was allowed on the express condition that the trial date remain as scheduled and the trial not be delayed. At no time did Fernandez indicate to the judge that this was her first trial. To the contrary, in her motion to appear, Fernandez explicitly stated \"I specialize in Criminal and Federal law.\" In light of the information before the trial judge at the time he made his decision and the \"great deal of latitude\" necessarily afforded judges in scheduling trials, <i>Morris,</i> 461 U.S. at 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110914\"><a href=\"/opinion/110914/morris-v-slappy/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the Supreme Court in <i>Strickland</i> implicitly affirmed the lower court's \"patently unreasonable\" formulation in the context of tactical decision-making, the standard employed by the trial court in evaluating Castillo's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not \"diametrically different,\" \"opposite in character or nature,\" or \"mutually opposed\" to <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Unreasonable Application of <i>Strickland</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his habeas petition to the district court, and now on appeal, Castillo argues that the trial court's resolution of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. Castillo's complaints fall into two broad categories. Under the first, Castillo alleges that Fernandez's failure to know the law resulted in the following errors: (1) stipulating that the substance found in the apartment was cocaine and that the total amount of cocaine exceeded 200 grams; (2) rejecting jury instructions on the lesser included offenses of simple possession and possession with intent to distribute; and (3) requesting a harmful joint venture jury instruction. Under the second, Castillo alleges that Fernandez's failure to know the facts caused her to (1) call Castillo to the stand after inadequate preparation; and (2) fail to call two witnesses (Ms. Mercado and Ms. Dominguez).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court viewed Castillo's performance-related allegations that counsel was ill-prepared and unqualified as \"mere Monday-morning quarterbacking.\" <i>Commonwealth v. Castillo,</i> No. 9477 CR 3461, slip op. at 6. The trial court found that Fernandez's performance was not \"measurably below that of an ordinarily fallible lawyer.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5. The court cited as evidence of the adequacy of her performance Fernandez's appropriate presentation of a number of pretrial motions, her effective cross-examination of the prosecution's witnesses, and a well-argued motion for a finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth's case as well as at the end of trial. The court's evaluation of counsel's performance from its contemporaneous perspective during trial is an appropriate application of <i>Strickland's</i> caution against the \"distorting effects of hindsight.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, there were details of their proposed testimony (such as their accounts of where he got the $467 in cash) that conflicted with Castillo's testimony. The trial court's determination that the decision not to call them to the stand was reasonable was an appropriate application of <i>Strickland's</i> insistence on the \"wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>. Similarly, the court viewed Fernandez's rejection of instructions on lesser offenses offered by the judge to be consistent with counsel's not-manifestly-unreasonable theory that Castillo had no knowledge of any drugs in the apartment. This determination is consistent with the acknowledgment in <i>Strickland</i> that \"[t]here are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case,\" and that there is a \"presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\" <i>Strickland</i> 466 U.S. at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span> (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most troubling of Fernandez's alleged errors is her stipulation to the quantity of drugs found in the apartment. By stipulating to 200 grams, Fernandez not only ensured that, if found guilty, Castillo would be sentenced to a minimum of fifteen years, but she also established as proven a fact from which the jury could draw the reasonable inference of intent to distribute. The trial court found this decision not to contest the quantity of drugs to be consistent with counsel's theory that Castillo did not know anything about the drugs present in the apartment, a theory of the case that the trial court concluded was not manifestly unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that Fernandez's decision to stipulate to the presence of the 200 grams or more of cocaine seems, from hindsight, somewhat puzzling. She could have concurrently maintained the theory that Castillo did not know about the drugs while requiring the Commonwealth to meet its burden of proof as to the quantity of cocaine found in the apartment. She received no apparent advantage from this concession. On the other hand, with 169 grams of cocaine found in the clear plastic bags thrown out the window, and several additional bags of cocaine in the brown paper bag on the table where Castillo was standing (along with the cocaine the jury might have assumed was flushed down the toilet), proof of the 200 gram minimum, in the absence of the stipulation, would probably not have taxed the prosecution greatly. Defense counsel might well have reasoned that a refusal to stipulate would only draw attention to the various quantities of drugs in the immediate area and thereby hurt, not help, her client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, given the consistency of this stipulation with Castillo's defense (an unawareness of the presence of drugs in the apartment), we can not say that the trial court's determination that this defense strategy \"was not manifestly unreasonable\" (and therefore did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel) rises to the level of \"unreasonableness\" required by the AEDPA statute. Indeed, in light of <i>Strickland's</i> implicit endorsement of the Fifth Circuit's \"patently unreasonable\" approach to the analysis of decision-making and its presumption that the challenged action \"might be considered sound trial strategy,\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

July 6, 2001) (Report and Recommendation of United States magistrate judge). Despite this clear warning, Castillo made limited objections to the magistrate judge's report. Respondent rightly argues that \"none of the proposed factual findings [to which petitioner objected], even if erroneous, provides a basis for habeas relief. The remaining aspects of petitioner's appeal comprise matters to which no objection was made and, therefore, are waived and not properly before this Court.\" In most circumstances we would enforce this important rule of waiver. <i>See Keating v.

Strictly applied here, this rule would mean that we would not be addressing the merits of any of Castillo's arguments on appeal, and there might be further claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in these post-conviction proceedings.

This is incorrect. The court applied the \"manifestly unreasonable\" standard to actions that it characterized as tactical or strategic. It applied a different test to Castillo's claims relating to trial counsel's inadequate preparation, qualifications to conduct the trial, and performance at the trial, concluding that \"Attorney Fernandez's performance [was not] measurably below that of an ordinarily fallible lawyer.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In citing with approval the Fifth Circuit's approach, the Supreme Court in<i>Strickland</i> noted that \"strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable,\" while \"strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 690-91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, rather than simply characterizing trial counsel's tactical decisions as \"unconsidered blunders,\" Castillo might have argued that the trial court erred by failing to distinguish between informed and uninformed tactical decision-making. However, those Circuits that have adopted the \"patently unreasonable\" formulation are divided on the question of whether <i>Strickland</i> accords heightened deference only to informed strategic choices. <i>See Epsom v.
