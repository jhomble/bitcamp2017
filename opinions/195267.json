(Tresca) brought  suit under section 303(b) of  the National\n\nLabor Relations Act  (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.    187(b), charging defen-\n\ndant-appellee Truck Drivers  Union, Local 170  (Local 170 or  the\n\nUnion) with unfair labor practices  during contract negotiations.\n\nFollowing  a two-day  bench trial,  the district  court concluded\n\nthat a  subcontracting proposal  advanced by  the Union during  a\n\nstrike had indeed violated both  NLRA sections 8(b)(4) and  8(e),\n\n29 U.S.C.   158(b)(4), (e), which prohibit, respectively, compul-\n\nsion against an employer  to require any self-employed  person to\n\njoin  a labor organization, and  to require an  employer to cease\n\ndoing business with  any party.  The  district court nevertheless\n\nfound that Tresca  had not established  a sufficient causal  link\n\nbetween the unlawful Union conduct and the injury Tresca alleged-\n\nly sustained as a result of the strike.  \n\n          In  March 1991,  Tresca, in  coalition with  four other\n\nready-mix  concrete  companies  (collectively  \"the  Companies\"),\n\nbegan contract  renewal negotiations  with Local  170.1   By  all\n\naccounts,  negotiations were  contentious from  the outset.   The\n\nCompanies sought  significant  work-rule modifications  (e.g.,  a\r                                                                       \n\nreduction from eight to four guaranteed hours' pay for each day a\n\ndriver is  called to work) and  benefit eligibility restrictions,\n\nwhich  the Union  considered  unacceptable.   The Union  proposed\n                    \r                              \n\n     1We outline only the  background necessary to an understand-\ning of the narrow issue presented on appeal.  \n\n                                2\r\n\nforty-two   separate  modifications  to  the  existing  contract,\n\nincluding  the  elimination of  the  arbitration  clause and  the\n\naddition of a subcontracting  clause, both deemed unacceptable by\n\nthe Companies.   After five acrimonious  bargaining sessions, the\n\nparties  remained at loggerheads.  On May 4, 1991, the membership\n\nof  Local 170 rejected the latest contract proposal by the Compa-\n\nnies and voted to go out on strike.  Although additional bargain-\n\ning  sessions  were convened  during  the  strike, the  stalemate\n\ncontinued. \n\n          The focal  point of  this appeal is  the subcontracting\n\nproposal  made  by the  Union at  the  May 9  bargaining session,\n\nwhereby the Companies  would be required to  sever their business\n\nrelationships with all non-union owner-operators hauling sand and\n\ngravel for the Companies.  The parties agree that the Union's May\n\n9 proposal was unlawful.  \n\n          At a  June 13  bargaining session, after  the Companies\n\nhad  filed a complaint  with the  National Labor  Relations Board\n\n(NLRB), the  Union formally withdrew  the unlawful May  9 subcon-\n\ntracting proposal.2  The  Companies' most recent \"final\" contract\n\nproposal,  containing demands for  significant work-rule changes,\n\nwas rejected by the membership of Local 170 the very next day, on\n\nJune  14.  In short order, the employers' coalition dissolved and\n\nindividual  companies began  separate contract  negotiations with\n                    \r                              \n\n     2The  NLRB declined to  issue a complaint.

Replacement workers  were  hired  and the  strike\n\ncontinues to this day.\n\n          The central  dispute at trial concerned  the importance\n\nattached by  the Union leadership  and membership to  the Union's\n\nunlawful subcontracting  proposal  and its  significance  in  the\n\ndecision to strike.  The Union contended that economic issues and\n\nthe work-rule concessions sought by the Companies  were always at\n\nthe  heart  of the  dispute.   Tresca  insisted that  the illegal\n\nsubcontracting  proposal was  presented  as an  ultimatum by  the\n\nUnion's negotiators and dominated the contract negotiations. \n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\n          Both parties  endorse the applicable legal  standard as\n\nexplained by the district court: \n\n          In order to make  a legal claim under Section\n          303(b) of  the NLRA, a party  must prove that\n          it was injured \"by reason of\" an unfair labor\n          practice.

Third, the  Union\n\nmembership rejected  another contract  proposal by  the Companies\n\nimmediately  after the  Union's unlawful  subcontracting proposal\r                            \n\nwas withdrawn on June 13.  Thus, there is no dispute that before,\n\nduring, and  after the time the  unlawful subcontracting proposal\n\nwas on the  bargaining table, the Union  membership was motivated\n\nby other concerns    unrelated to the subcontracting proposal    \n\nfor   which  the   membership  was   ready  to   strike.     This\n\ncircumstantial evidence alone provided  plausible support for the\n\ndistrict court finding. \n\n                                6\r\n\n          There remains  only the question of  the motivations of\n\nUnion negotiators.4  Tresca  insists that there is uncontroverted\n\nevidence  that  the  Union  negotiators  presented  the  unlawful\n\nsubcontracting proposal as an ultimatum.  The record simply  does\n\nnot  bear this out.   The witnesses  presented by the  parties at\n\ntrial  gave  diametrically  opposed   accounts  as  to  when  the\n\nsubcontracting  proposal was presented and whether subcontracting\n\nwas  the key issue, as  Tresca maintains, or  simply a bargaining\r                  \n\nchip, as  the Union claims.   The only  objective non-testimonial\n\nevidence presented  by Tresca  indicates that  the subcontracting\n\nproposal first surfaced at the May 9 bargaining session.

The district court clearly credited the testimony of\r                    \n\nLocal 170's chief negotiator.5\n\n          \"[W]hen  factual findings  are based  on determinations\n\nregarding the credibility of witnesses,  Rule 52 demands that the\n\nappeals court accord even greater deference to the  trial court's\n\nfindings.\"   Rodriguez-Morales v.

Based  on its credibility determination relating  to the\n\nUnion's   motivation,   and   the  undisputed   fact   that   the\n\nsubcontracting proposal was not a strike motivation for the Union\n\nmembership,  there  was no  clear  error  in the  district  court\n\nfinding  that  the  May  9  subcontracting  proposal  was  not  a\n\nmotivation behind the strike.   Accordingly, we affirm its ruling\n\nthat Union liability under NLRA   303(b) was foreclosed. \n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r                            \n                    \r                              \n\n     5Near  the end of the trial, the district court outlined for\ncounsel the credibility problem confronting Tresca: \n\n     You  have had a witness on the stand here who said that\n     [the  Union's negotiator] says \"I am  going to get this\n     [subcontracting]  proposal . . . I have been wanting to\n     do  it a  hundred  years and  this  is life  or  death.\n     Without this, nothing.\"\n          .  .  .  I  presume  that  somebody  is  going  to\n     corroborate it.  These are the people that were  there.\n     Are they going to corroborate it or aren't they?  There\n     is no subtlety here.

(Tresca) brought  suit under section 303(b) of  the National\n\nLabor Relations Act  (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.    187(b), charging defen-\n\ndant-appellee Truck Drivers  Union, Local 170  (Local 170 or  the\n\nUnion) with unfair labor practices  during contract negotiations.\n\nFollowing  a two-day  bench trial,  the district  court concluded\n\nthat a  subcontracting proposal  advanced by  the Union during  a\n\nstrike had indeed violated both  NLRA sections 8(b)(4) and  8(e),\n\n29 U.S.C.   158(b)(4), (e), which prohibit, respectively, compul-\n\nsion against an employer  to require any self-employed  person to\n\njoin  a labor organization, and  to require an  employer to cease\n\ndoing business with  any party.  The  district court nevertheless\n\nfound that Tresca  had not established  a sufficient causal  link\n\nbetween the unlawful Union conduct and the injury Tresca alleged-\n\nly sustained as a result of the strike.  \n\n          In  March 1991,  Tresca, in  coalition with  four other\n\nready-mix  concrete  companies  (collectively  \"the  Companies\"),\n\nbegan contract  renewal negotiations  with Local  170.1   By  all\n\naccounts,  negotiations were  contentious from  the outset.   The\n\nCompanies sought  significant  work-rule modifications  (e.g.,  a\r                                                                       \n\nreduction from eight to four guaranteed hours' pay for each day a\n\ndriver is  called to work) and  benefit eligibility restrictions,\n\nwhich  the Union  considered  unacceptable.   The Union  proposed\n                    \r                              \n\n     1We outline only the  background necessary to an understand-\ning of the narrow issue presented on appeal.  \n\n                                2\r\n\nforty-two   separate  modifications  to  the  existing  contract,\n\nincluding  the  elimination of  the  arbitration  clause and  the\n\naddition of a subcontracting  clause, both deemed unacceptable by\n\nthe Companies.   After five acrimonious  bargaining sessions, the\n\nparties  remained at loggerheads.  On May 4, 1991, the membership\n\nof  Local 170 rejected the latest contract proposal by the Compa-\n\nnies and voted to go out on strike.  Although additional bargain-\n\ning  sessions  were convened  during  the  strike, the  stalemate\n\ncontinued. \n\n          The focal  point of  this appeal is  the subcontracting\n\nproposal  made  by the  Union at  the  May 9  bargaining session,\n\nwhereby the Companies  would be required to  sever their business\n\nrelationships with all non-union owner-operators hauling sand and\n\ngravel for the Companies.  The parties agree that the Union's May\n\n9 proposal was unlawful.  \n\n          At a  June 13  bargaining session, after  the Companies\n\nhad  filed a complaint  with the  National Labor  Relations Board\n\n(NLRB), the  Union formally withdrew  the unlawful May  9 subcon-\n\ntracting proposal.2  The  Companies' most recent \"final\" contract\n\nproposal,  containing demands for  significant work-rule changes,\n\nwas rejected by the membership of Local 170 the very next day, on\n\nJune  14.  In short order, the employers' coalition dissolved and\n\nindividual  companies began  separate contract  negotiations with\n                    \r                              \n\n     2The  NLRB declined to  issue a complaint.

Replacement workers  were  hired  and the  strike\n\ncontinues to this day.\n\n          The central  dispute at trial concerned  the importance\n\nattached by  the Union leadership  and membership to  the Union's\n\nunlawful subcontracting  proposal  and its  significance  in  the\n\ndecision to strike.  The Union contended that economic issues and\n\nthe work-rule concessions sought by the Companies  were always at\n\nthe  heart  of the  dispute.   Tresca  insisted that  the illegal\n\nsubcontracting  proposal was  presented  as an  ultimatum by  the\n\nUnion's negotiators and dominated the contract negotiations. \n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\n          Both parties  endorse the applicable legal  standard as\n\nexplained by the district court: \n\n          In order to make  a legal claim under Section\n          303(b) of  the NLRA, a party  must prove that\n          it was injured \"by reason of\" an unfair labor\n          practice. [This phrase] has  been interpreted\n          to mean  there must be some  causal nexus be-\n          tween the unfair labor practice and the inju-\n          ry allegedly suffered.  Mead v.

Third, the  Union\n\nmembership rejected  another contract  proposal by  the Companies\n\nimmediately  after the  Union's unlawful  subcontracting proposal\r                            \n\nwas withdrawn on June 13.  Thus, there is no dispute that before,\n\nduring, and  after the time the  unlawful subcontracting proposal\n\nwas on the  bargaining table, the Union  membership was motivated\n\nby other concerns    unrelated to the subcontracting proposal    \n\nfor   which  the   membership  was   ready  to   strike.     This\n\ncircumstantial evidence alone provided  plausible support for the\n\ndistrict court finding. \n\n                                6\r\n\n          There remains  only the question of  the motivations of\n\nUnion negotiators.4  Tresca  insists that there is uncontroverted\n\nevidence  that  the  Union  negotiators  presented  the  unlawful\n\nsubcontracting proposal as an ultimatum.  The record simply  does\n\nnot  bear this out.   The witnesses  presented by the  parties at\n\ntrial  gave  diametrically  opposed   accounts  as  to  when  the\n\nsubcontracting  proposal was presented and whether subcontracting\n\nwas  the key issue, as  Tresca maintains, or  simply a bargaining\r                  \n\nchip, as  the Union claims.   The only  objective non-testimonial\n\nevidence presented  by Tresca  indicates that  the subcontracting\n\nproposal first surfaced at the May 9 bargaining session.  But the\n\ntiming of  the subcontracting proposal, while  relevant, does not\n\ndetermine the outcome of the motivation test required under Mead.\r                                                                          \n\nRather, in the present context,  the question whether the strike,\n\nor its prolongment, was  motivated by the subcontracting proposal\n\nturns  on the  actions and  intent of  the  Union representatives\r                                            \n\nresponsible for the decision  to inject it as  an element in  the\n\ncollective bargaining.  \n\n          The chief negotiator for the  Union specifically denied\n\nthat the May 9  subcontracting proposal was ever presented  as an\n                    \r                              \n\n     4The record does not support Tresca's unnatural reading that\nthe district  court's findings on motivation for  the strike, see\r                                                                           \nsupra at  p.4, addressed  only the  motivations  of the  striking\r               \nemployees and not those  of the Union negotiators.   The district\ncourt finding itself contains no such qualification, nor is there\nany  evidence  that  the   strike  motivations  harbored  by  the\r                                                        \nmembership  differed  substantially  from  those  of  the   Union\nnegotiators.\n\n                                7\r\n\nultimatum, and expressly denied that it was ever a motivation for\r                                                                           \n\nthe strike.  The district court clearly credited the testimony of\r                    \n\nLocal 170's chief negotiator.5\n\n          \"[W]hen  factual findings  are based  on determinations\n\nregarding the credibility of witnesses,  Rule 52 demands that the\n\nappeals court accord even greater deference to the  trial court's\n\nfindings.\"   Rodriguez-Morales v.

Based  on its credibility determination relating  to the\n\nUnion's   motivation,   and   the  undisputed   fact   that   the\n\nsubcontracting proposal was not a strike motivation for the Union\n\nmembership,  there  was no  clear  error  in the  district  court\n\nfinding  that  the  May  9  subcontracting  proposal  was  not  a\n\nmotivation behind the strike.
