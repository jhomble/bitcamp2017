A group of African-American voters\n\nand related organizations brought a challenge under § 2 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (2000), to the Rhode Island\n\nstate senate redistricting plan adopted in 2002.     They allege that\n\nalthough African-Americans did not constitute a numerical majority\n\nin any state senate district before redistricting, they have\n\nhistorically had the ability to elect a representative of their\n\nchoice with the help of crossover votes in one of the former\n\ndistricts.    They claim that as a result of the redistricting plan,\n\nthis opportunity has been adversely affected (indeed, eliminated)\n\nby the reduction of the African-American percentage in the relevant\n\ndistrict.     After the districts were redrawn, their candidate of\n\nchoice, at that time an incumbent, lost his seat in the Democratic\n\nParty primary.      Because of the makeup of the newly configured\n\ndistrict, the victor in the primary was effectively assured of\n\nbeing the victor in the general election.1\n\n             The district court dismissed the claim under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(b)(6) because the African-American group could not form a\n\nnumerical majority in any district and because that group would\n\nrequire crossover votes to elect a candidate of its choice.     Under\n\n\n     1\n       While the loss of the incumbent, Charles D. Walton, in\nSenate District 9 is not part of the plaintiffs' complaint, we take\njudicial notice of this electoral outcome. The fact of his loss is\nundisputed and has been referred to by the parties. It is also an\neasy inference from the complaint that the African-American voters'\ncandidate of choice would lose after and as a result of the\nredistricting process.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthe standard for Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, which permits dismissal\n\nof a complaint \"only if it is clear that no relief could be granted\n\nunder any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the\n\nallegations,\"      Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984),\n\nwe reverse the dismissal of the claim.2\n\n                                        I.\n\n          On May 2, 2002, a group of individual plaintiffs and\n\nadvocacy organizations challenged the redistricting plan in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Rhode Island under\n\n§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA), 42 U.S.C. § 1973.                        The\n\nplaintiffs    named   as    defendants       the   Governor,   the    Lieutenant\n\nGovernor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the State\n\nBoard of Elections Chairman, the Secretary of State, and the Senate\n\nMajority Leader.3\n\n             When reviewing the dismissal of a complaint under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), \"[w]e accept as true the well-pleaded factual\n\nallegations   of    the    complaint,    draw      all   reasonable   inferences\n\ntherefrom in the plaintiff's favor and determine whether the\n\ncomplaint, so read, sets forth facts sufficient to justify recovery\n\non any cognizable theory.\" Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc.,\n\n\n     2\n         We express our appreciation to amici for their valuable\nassistance.\n     3\n       Many of the defendants originally sued in their official\ncapacities no longer occupy their respective offices. The current\nincumbents have been substituted as defendants for their\npredecessors in office. See Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f284 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2002).                 Thus, the following facts are\n\nderived from the plaintiffs' amended complaint.\n\n               On February 23, 2002, the Rhode Island General Assembly\n\nvoted to pass a redistricting plan for the state senate.                      An\n\nalteration was necessary for two reasons.               First, there was a need\n\nto adjust the senate districts to account for shifts in state\n\npopulation.        Second,   a    recent     state    constitutional    amendment\n\nreduced the number of senate districts from fifty to thirty-eight,\n\nnecessitating an entirely new district map with larger districts.\n\n               The new senate district plan was highly controversial.\n\nThere were concerns from the beginning that the plan might make it\n\nmore difficult for African-American voters to elect candidates of\n\ntheir choice.       Various community groups and individuals testified\n\nbefore the legislature against the plan on the grounds that it\n\nwould not give African-American voters \"an equal opportunity to\n\nelect candidates of their choice\" to the state senate, and that the\n\nplan unnecessarily abridged the voting rights of African-American\n\nvoters    in    violation    of   the    VRA.      Nonetheless,   the   senate's\n\njudiciary committee \"approved the plan[] without taking the time to\n\nevaluate the proposals and comments of those opposed to the plan.\"\n\nIt is fair to infer, given that there was only one African-American\n\nsenator, that the plan was approved over the objections of the\n\nAfrican-American      community        and   its   representative.       Governor\n\nLincoln    Almond     refused     to    sign    the   legislation,     explicitly\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fquestioning its fairness to Rhode Island's minority populations.\n\nHe did not veto it, however, and the plan became law without his\n\nsignature on February 23, 2002.\n\n          The population of Rhode Island is four percent African-\n\nAmerican,4 over half of whom live in Providence.                 The state's\n\nAfrican-American citizens continue to suffer from past official\n\ndiscrimination in housing, education, health care, and employment.\n\nBy   common   measures   of    socio-economic      status,       educational\n\nattainment, and access to political resources, they continue to lag\n\nbehind the rest of the state.          Only one African-American state\n\nsenator, the chosen candidate of the African-American community,\n\nhas ever been elected in Rhode Island; that senator, Charles D.\n\nWalton,   represented    the   old     Senate   District     9    until   the\n\nredistricting.   According to the census data from the year 2000,\n\nthat district was 25.69% African-American and 41.08% Hispanic.\n\nMuch of Providence's African-American population is now within the\n\nnew Senate District 2.     The population of this new district is\n\n21.42% African-American and 46.74% Hispanic, and the voting age\n\npopulation is 21.43% African-American and 43.12% Hispanic.5\n\n\n     4\n       The complaint makes a distinction between Hispanic voters\nand \"Non-Hispanic African-American\" voters.      We use \"African-\nAmerican\" to describe the latter group, as distinguished from\nHispanic African-Americans, whom the complaint counts as members of\nthe Hispanic community.\n     5\n       The complaint does not specify the voting age population\ndemographics of the old Senate District 9, nor does it specify the\npercentage of the population that is white in either the old Senate\n\n                                     -6-\n\f           Plaintiffs plead that the African-American voters in\n\nRhode Island are themselves politically cohesive, and that they are\n\nnot   cohesive   with   Hispanic    or    white   voters.   Although   no\n\nalternative plans were appended to the complaint, plaintiffs claim\n\nthat it is possible to divide the state into thirty-eight districts\n\nsuch that one senate district would have a population that is at\n\nleast twenty-six percent African-American, and in such a district\n\nit would be possible for \"an African-American candidate preferred\n\nby African-American voters\" to win election due to white and\n\nHispanic crossover support.        However, if a district is less than\n\ntwenty-six percent African-American, \"[t]he white and Hispanic\n\ncommunities vote sufficiently in a bloc usually to defeat the\n\ncandidate of choice of African-American voters.\"\n\n                                    II.\n\n           Without filing a responsive pleading, the defendants\n\nquickly moved to dismiss on the basis of Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)\n\nfor failure to state a claim.      They argued that the complaint fails\n\nto allege that it is possible to create a senate district in which\n\nAfrican-Americans are a majority, and that such an allegation is\n\nrequired by Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), and its\n\nprogeny.\n\n           On September 9, 2002, the district court granted the\n\ndefendants' motion.     Metts v. Almond, 217 F. Supp. 2d 252 (D.R.I.\n\n\nDistrict 9 or the new Senate District 2.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f2002).     The district court analyzed the plaintiffs' complaint as\n\nboth an \"ability to influence\" claim and an \"ability to elect\"\n\nclaim.     As to the former, it found that influence claims are not\n\ncognizable under § 2.        Id. at 257.         As to the latter, it held that\n\nGingles requires that a minority group be able to constitute a\n\nmajority without the help of crossover votes from other groups.\n\nId. at 260.        Finally, the district court also dismissed the\n\ncomplaint based upon a failure to demonstrate that the majority in\n\nSenate District 9 votes as a bloc, another requirement set out in\n\nGingles.     Id. at 260-61.        The plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of\n\ntheir claim.\n\n                                      III.\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint    for   failure    to    state    a    claim   under   Rule   12(b)(6),\n\nMorales-Villalobos v. Garcia-Llorens, 316 F.3d 51, 52 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), taking well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and\n\nmaking all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\nArruda v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 310 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits dismissal of a complaint for \"failure of the\n\npleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\"                   For\n\nthe purposes of Rule 12(b)(6), \"it is enough for a plaintiff to\n\nsketch a scenario which, if subsequently fleshed out by means of\n\nappropriate facts, could support an actionable claim.\"                   Garrett v.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fTandy Corp., 295 F.3d 94, 105 (1st Cir. 2002).   We must reverse if\n\nthe plaintiffs have included in their complaint well-pleaded facts\n\nwhich, taken as true, \"justify recovery on any supportable legal\n\ntheory.\"   Cruz v. Melecio, 204 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nB.   Legal Background\n\n           Section 2 of the VRA forbids any \"voting qualification or\n\nprerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure . . .\n\nwhich results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any\n\ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).    First passed in 1965, it was amended in 1982\n\nto specify that the test is one of adverse impact to minority\n\ncommunities and does not require a showing of discriminatory\n\nintent.6    Pub. L. No. 89-110, tit. I, § 2, 79 Stat. 437, 437\n\n(1965), amended by Pub. L. No. 97-205, § 3, 96 Stat. 131, 134\n\n(1982).    A violation is established \"if, based on the totality of\n\ncircumstances, it is shown that . . . a class of citizens . . .\n\n[has] less opportunity than other members of the electorate to\n\nparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives\n\nof their choice.\"   42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n           The Supreme Court first construed the post-amendment VRA\n\n\n\n     6\n       The amendment was meant, in part, to overturn the Supreme\nCourt's interpretation of the VRA in City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446\nU.S. 55, 61 (1980). See P. McCrary, Bringing Equality to Power:\nHow the Federal Courts Transformed the Electoral Structure of\nSouthern Politics, 1960-1990, 5 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 665, 697-699\n(2003).\n\n                                 -9-\n\fin Thornburg v. Gingles, supra.            Gingles was a challenge to a\n\nredistricting plan that included multimember districts, which are\n\nlegislative districts from which more than one representative is\n\nelected at a time.       478 U.S. at 35.   The Gingles court established\n\nthree \"preconditions\" for a VRA challenge to multimember districts.\n\n          First, the minority group must be able to demonstrate\n          that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact\n          to constitute a majority in a single-member district. .\n          . . Second, the minority group must be able to show that\n          it is politically cohesive. . . . Third, the minority\n          must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes\n          sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to\n          defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\n\nId. at 50-51.      The Supreme Court has, in subsequent cases, held\n\nthat some form of these three preconditions should also apply to\n\nchallenges   to   single-member    legislative    districts.     Growe   v.\n\nEmison,   507     U.S.    25,   40-41   (1993)   (applying     the   second\n\nprecondition); see also Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 157-58\n\n(1993) (applying the third precondition). The Court has summarized\n\nthe three in shorthand terms as \"compactness/numerousness, minority\n\ncohesion or bloc voting, and majority bloc voting.\"          Johnson v. De\n\nGrandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1011 (1994).          As a matter of pleading, the\n\ncomplaint explicitly pleads the second and third of the Gingles\n\npreconditions as well as geographic compactness under the first\n\nprecondition.\n\n          This is not a case, as in De Grandy, where minority\n\nvoters hold a majority in some districts and the issue is whether\n\n§ 2 of the VRA requires courts to maximize the number of districts\n\n                                    -10-\n\fin which minority voters may elect their candidates of choice.\n\nHere, the only district in which African-American voters could\n\nelect a candidate of their choice (with help from crossover voting)\n\nwas altered significantly; the result, plaintiffs say, is that\n\nAfrican-American voters can no longer elect a candidate of their\n\nchoice in any state senatorial district. Far from complaining that\n\nthe legislature has failed to maximize their political power, these\n\nplaintiffs complain that their opportunity to elect a candidate of\n\ntheir choice has been minimized -- indeed, eliminated.\n\nC.   First Precondition: Compactness & Numerousness\n\n          1.    Ability to Influence and Crossover Voting\n\n          The district court characterized plaintiffs' claim as\n\nalternately an \"ability to influence\" claim and an \"ability to\n\nelect\" claim.        The   Gingles Court,    when   fashioning    the   three\n\npreconditions   to    a    redistricting    challenge   to   a   multimember\n\ndistrict, expressly reserved the question of whether § 2 permitted\n\nclaims by a minority group \"alleging that the use of a multimember\n\ndistrict impairs its ability to influence elections,\" and whether\n\nthe three preconditions would apply unabated to such a claim.             478\n\nU.S. at 46 n.12 (emphasis in original).         The same question of the\n\nmeaning of an ability to elect as opposed to an ability to\n\ninfluence arises in challenges to single member districts.              See De\n\nGrandy, 512 U.S. at 1008-09; Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 154.\n\n          Since Gingles, there has been much confusion over the\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fdefinition of an influence claim under the VRA.                        Most often,\n\ninfluence districts have been defined as ones \"in which a minority\n\ngroup has enough political heft to exert significant influence on\n\nthe   choice    of     candidate   though   not    enough      to   determine   that\n\nchoice.\"    Barnett v. City of Chicago, 141 F.3d 699, 703 (7th Cir.\n\n1998) (reserving question of whether such a claim is cognizable);\n\nsee Cousin v. Sundquist, 145 F.3d 818, 828-29 (6th Cir. 1998)\n\n(refusing to recognize such a claim under the VRA); McNeil v.\n\nLegislative Apportionment Comm'n, 828 A.2d 840, 852-53 (N.J. 2003)\n\n(recognizing influence dilution claims under the VRA).                  This court\n\nhas also used the \"influence district\" terminology in this sense.\n\nVecinos de Barrio Uno v. City of Holyoke, 72 F.3d 973, 990-91 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n            The confusion stems from the intersection of this type of\n\ninfluence      claim    and   another    type,    in   which    a   minority    group\n\nconstituting less than fifty percent of the electorate can elect a\n\ncandidate of its choice with the help of crossover votes from\n\nvoters in the majority group.            See R.H. Pildes, Is Voting Rights\n\nLaw Now at War with Itself?             Social Science and Voting Rights in\n\nthe 2000s, 80 N.C. L. Rev. 1517, 1539-40 & n.60 (2002) (referring\n\nto this latter type of district as a \"coalitional district\"); Note,\n\nThe Future of Majority-Minority Districts in Light of Declining\n\nRacially Polarized Voting, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 2208, 2209-10 & n.13\n\n(2003).    We will refer to this second type of influence claim as a\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f\"crossover    district.\"7     The   Supreme   Court   has   not   had   the\n\nopportunity to address this distinction;8 the Court in Voinovich\n\nused the term \"influence district\" to describe a crossover district\n\n-- one in which minorities could, despite the inability to form a\n\nmajority, \"elect their candidate of choice nonetheless if they are\n\nnumerous enough and their candidate attracts sufficient cross-over\n\nvotes.\"   507 U.S. at 154.9\n\n             Plaintiffs, for their part, forswear any claim under the\n\nability to influence rubric, choosing to stand or fall entirely on\n\nan ability to elect claim.     However, they do so only as far as the\n\n\n     7\n       We use \"crossover\" in a specialized sense with regard to\nracial blocs.  The term is also used in a different sense when\nmembers of one political party cross over to vote in the other\nparty's primary.   See Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 245\n(2001).\n     8\n       The recent Supreme Court decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft,\n123 S.Ct. 2498 (2003), considered influence districts and crossover\ndistricts in the § 5 context, but did not resolve the relationship\nbetween the two.\n     9\n       Crossover districts where plaintiffs allege an ability to\nelect also may be confused with a third type of claim, a \"minority\ncoalition\" claim, in which two separate minority groups allege that\na district could be formed in which they could join forces to elect\na representative. See De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1020 (describing such\na VRA claim); Concerned Citizens v. Hardee County Bd., 906 F.2d\n524, 526-27 (11th Cir. 1990) (indicating that minority coalition\nclaims meet the first Gingles precondition); Brewer v. Ham, 876\nF.2d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 1989) (same).       But see Nixon v. Kent\nCounty, 76 F.3d 1381, 1392 (6th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (rejecting a\nminority coalition claim).\n     We take no position on that issue. Plaintiffs do not allege\nthat they and another minority group form a minority coalition and\nthat such a coalition may qualify as a \"class\" under § 2. Rather,\nthis suit appears to posit that the interests of African-American\nvoters have been pitted against the interests of Hispanic voters.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fterm \"influence district\" describes one where a minority group is\n\nunable to elect a candidate of its choice even with crossover\n\nsupport.    They use the term \"influence district\" in the complaint\n\nto describe what we label a crossover district, in which African-\n\nAmerican voters have an ability to elect with crossover support.\n\nWe consider only this type of influence claim, and not the more\n\nnebulous variety described in Barnett and disavowed by plaintiffs.\n\n              The Supreme Court has expressly held open the question\n\nof whether the Gingles preconditions should apply to influence\n\nclaims.    See De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1009; Voinovich, 507 U.S. at\n\n154; Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46 n.12.          We read the language of these\n\ncases, especially Gingles and Voinovich, to profess a willingness\n\nto consider a crossover district claim such as the one plaintiffs\n\nplead.     The Gingles language setting aside the question of an\n\ninfluence claim did not differentiate between crossover district\n\nclaims and claims in which plaintiffs profess only an ability to\n\naffect, not determine, electoral outcomes.           But the Court has not\n\nflatly    refused    to   consider   a   crossover   district    despite   the\n\nopportunity to do so.         See Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 154.\n\n            The     Supreme   Court's    recent   opinion   in   Georgia   v.\n\nAshcroft, 123 S.Ct. 2498 (2003), also supports our conclusion that\n\ncrossover districts should be considered in the § 2 context.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fGeorgia interpreted § 5 of the VRA.10      The Court has repeatedly\n\nwarned that § 2 and § 5 \"combat different evils and . . . impose\n\nvery different duties upon the States.\"      Reno v. Bossier Parish\n\nSch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 476 (1997).         Despite the differences\n\nbetween § 2 and § 5 analysis, the Court's treatment of influence\n\nand crossover districts in Georgia is highly instructive.\n\n          Georgia held that when assessing retrogression, courts\n\nmust consider not only majority-minority districts but also the\n\nexistence of influence districts, including crossover districts.\n\n123 S.Ct. at 2512.     The state's plan created two additional\n\ndistricts with a minority population of between thirty and fifty\n\npercent, and two districts with a population of between twenty-five\n\nand thirty percent. These districts, the Court found, were crucial\n\nto determining the overall effect of the new redistricting plan.\n\nId. at 2515.    Indeed, the Court was unanimous that crossover\n\ndistricts should be considered in the § 5 analysis; the dissent\n\nobjected only to the use of those influence districts in which it\n\nwas not clear that minority voters would have an ability to elect\n\neven with crossover support.    See id. at 2513, 2514; id. at 2518-19\n\n(Souter, J., dissenting).      If crossover districts are important\n\n\n     10\n        Under § 5, the Attorney General of the United States must\npreclear a covered jurisdiction's \"standard, practice, or\nprocedure.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973c. Preclearance depends on whether\nthe change \"would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial\nminorities with respect to their effective exercise of the\nelectoral franchise.\" Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 141\n(1976).\n\n                                 -15-\n\fenough to    minority      voters    to    be    considered        when    assessing   a\n\nredistricting plan's retrogression, it would be an odd result if\n\nthe same voters could not bring a § 2 claim when such a crossover\n\ndistrict is eliminated by redistricting.\n\n            Given these Supreme Court precedents, we believe that\n\nwhatever the status of other influence claims, at least crossover\n\ndistrict claims are cognizable under § 2 of the VRA.                      We decline to\n\nhold, as a matter of law, that they are not.\n\n            This   conclusion       is    consistent        with    our    decision    in\n\nVecinos de Barrio Uno, supra, where this court held that an\n\n\"influence district\" that was twenty-eight percent Hispanic should\n\nbe    considered   in     the   determination          of   whether       the   minority\n\npopulation's voting strength had been diluted.                     72 F.3d at 990-91\n\n(\"[T]he voting strength of a minority group is not necessarily\n\nlimited to districts in which its members constitute a majority of\n\nthe voting age population, but also extends to every district in\n\nwhich its members are sufficiently numerous to have a significant\n\nimpact at the ballot box most of the time.\").                      Unlike the present\n\ncase, the influence district in Vecinos de Barrio Uno was used by\n\nthe   defendant    city    as   evidence        that    the   minority      population\n\nretained political power. Moreover, the city was not alleging that\n\nthe minority group could elect its own candidate with crossover\n\nsupport, but only that it was large enough to wield influence over\n\nthe outcome.       Despite these factual differences, this court's\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\frecognition that influence districts may be used to show the\n\nexistence of the political power of minority groups reinforces the\n\ndecision to recognize, at least in theory, a suit complaining that\n\na crossover district has been unjustly eliminated.\n\n          Though   Gingles   did    not   apply   the   preconditions   to\n\ninfluence claims, however they are defined, some preconditions must\n\napply in order to link the complained-of voting practice with the\n\nharm the plaintiffs allege.         Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48-51; see\n\nVecinos, 72 F.3d at 979 n.2 (\"[The first] precondition will have to\n\nbe reconfigured to the extent that the courts eventually validate\n\nso-called influence dilution claims.\").       For the purposes of this\n\ndiscussion, we assume that plaintiffs' claim must satisfy the\n\nsecond and third Gingles preconditions, and that some form of the\n\nfirst precondition will also apply.\n\n          2.    Majority Requirement\n\n          The   first   Gingles    precondition    requires   that   \"the\n\nminority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently\n\nlarge and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a\n\nsingle-member district.\"     478 U.S. at 50.      Some courts have read\n\nthis literally to mean that unless plaintiffs can show that they\n\ncan constitute an absolute majority in a single district -- that\n\nis, more than fifty percent -- then there is no possible § 2\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fclaim.11    See Valdespino v. Alamo Heights Indep. Sch. Dist., 168\n\nF.3d 848, 852-53 (5th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1114\n\n(2000); Perez v. Pasadena Indep. Sch. Dist., 165 F.3d 368, 371-73\n\n(5th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1114 (2000); see also\n\nNegron v. City of Miami Beach, 113 F.3d 1563, 1571 (11th Cir.\n\n1997); Parker v. Ohio, 263 F. Supp. 2d 1100, 1104-05 (S.D. Ohio\n\n2003).      That   approach     has   been   criticized     as   a   \"talismanic\n\nrequirement, divorced from any underlying functional reasons.\"\n\nPildes, supra, at 1555.          If that approach were followed here,\n\nplaintiffs' complaint would fail to meet the first precondition.\n\n            We reject the conclusion that no § 2 cause of action is\n\never    stated,    regardless    of   the    nature   of   the   claim,   unless\n\nplaintiffs can show that a minority group would be a literal\n\nmajority in a single district.          The approach is inconsistent with\n\nthe Supreme Court's own descriptions of the functions served by the\n\nfirst Gingles precondition.           It is also inconsistent with the\n\nvariety of political realities the VRA was meant to address; a\n\ndemographic fact of life in some areas of the country is that no\n\nsingle racial group constitutes an absolute majority. And finally,\n\nit contravenes the plain text of § 2, which requires courts to\n\nconsider the \"totality of the circumstances.\"\n\n\n\n       11\n       On defendants' theory, a discrete, geographically compact\nracial group (here, African-Americans) is not entitled to avail\nitself of § 2 of the VRA until it is large enough to constitute a\nnumerical majority in any given district.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f            Requiring the protected class to show that it is an\n\nabsolute majority ignores the reality that the class could elect\n\nits preferred candidate without such numbers.          Thus, a discussion\n\nof   whether     the   protected   class   forms   a   \"majority\"    is   not\n\nnecessarily helpful in determining whether an \"electoral law,\n\npractice,   or    structure    interacts   with    social   and   historical\n\nconditions,\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47, to impair the ability of the\n\nclass to vote.         The plaintiffs here have alleged that African-\n\nAmerican voters formed a politically cohesive group that was able,\n\nwith the assistance of crossover voting, to elect the candidate of\n\nits preference in a district that was less than fifty percent\n\nAfrican-American and that, in a properly drawn district, they could\n\ncontinue to do so.\n\n            In the context of this case, that pleading suffices to\n\nsatisfy the interests identified by the Supreme Court for the first\n\nGingles precondition. That precondition should not be read without\n\nregard to its function: to determine whether \"the ability of\n\nminority voters to elect representatives of their choice\" is\n\nimpeded.    Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48.       As the Court has noted, \"the\n\nGingles factors cannot be applied mechanically and without regard\n\nto the nature of the claim.\"       Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 158.12     Gingles\n\n\n     12\n        Consonant with its holding that the Gingles preconditions\nare in some form applicable to single-member districts, the Supreme\nCourt has consistently avoided applying the first precondition to\nchallenges to such districts.     See De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1009\n(assuming the first precondition is satisfied); Voinovich, 507 U.S.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fitself, in reviewing a multi-member district, noted that the\n\nfunction of the first precondition was to assure that there was a\n\ncausal relationship between the creation of the district lines and\n\nthe harm to the plaintiffs; if the minority group's candidate could\n\nnot prevail even in a single district, then \"the multimember form\n\ncannot be responsible for minority voters' inability to elect its\n\ncandidates.\"     478 U.S. at 50 (emphasis removed).           Similarly, when\n\ndiscussing    majority   bloc   voting    in    the    context    of   the   third\n\nprecondition, Gingles defined it as that which is sufficient\n\nusually to \"defeat the combined strength of minority support plus\n\nwhite crossover votes.\"         Id. at 56 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Jenkins v. Red Clay Consol. Sch. Dist. Bd. of\n\nEduc., 4 F.3d 1103, 1123 (3d Cir. 1993) (\"[T]he Gingles [third\n\nprecondition]    standard   presupposes        the    existence   of   crossover\n\nvoting.\").    Growe reinforced this functional analysis, noting that\n\n\"the 'geographically compact majority' and 'minority political\n\ncohesion' showings are needed to establish that the minority has\n\nthe potential to elect a representative of its own choice in some\n\nsingle-member district.\"        507 U.S. at 40.           Such support for a\n\nfunctional approach leaves room to include claims in which an\n\nelectoral majority is formed only with crossover support.\n\n             This functional approach also better accounts for various\n\npolitical realities. In electoral schemes in which representatives\n\n\nat 158 (same); Growe, 507 U.S. at 41 (same).\n\n                                   -20-\n\fcan usually be elected with less than a majority of the vote,\n\nGingles should not be read to require that the minority group\n\nnevertheless be able to form a literal majority in a reconfigured\n\ndistrict.    Rhode Island law specifically provides that candidates\n\nin both primary and general elections for state office may be\n\nelected with a plurality of the vote.        See R.I. Const. art. IV, §\n\n2 (general elections); R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-15-29 (2002) (primary\n\nelections).    In such cases, constituting a majority would not be\n\nnecessary for minorities to \"elect a representative of their\n\nchoice.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b); see Romero v. Pomona, 883 F.2d 1418,\n\n1424 n.7 (9th Cir. 1989), overruled on other grounds, 929 F.2d 1358\n\n(9th Cir. 1990).13    \"To the extent that courts have read Gingles to\n\nelevate the ability to create a district with a majority-black\n\nelectorate into a threshold requirement for establishing liability\n\nin all vote dilution litigation, they have improperly applied one\n\nparticular theory of liability to other distinct types of vote\n\ndilution.\"     P.S.

Ashcroft,   supra,   confirms   that    influence\n\n\n\n     13\n       But see Brewer, 876 F.2d at 454 (requiring a majority even\nfor plurality elections, reasoning that a \"plurality feature is of\ncourse more responsive to minority voter groups\"); McNeil v.\nSpringfield Park Dist., 851 F.2d 937, 943-44 (7th Cir. 1988)\n(rejecting any showing of less than an absolute majority as unduly\nspeculative).\n\n                                   -21-\n\fdistricts, including crossover districts, are important to any\n\npractical assessment of minority voting power.                 In Georgia, the\n\nCourt emphasized the fact-bound nature of VRA claims, holding that\n\nthe retrogression inquiry under § 5, like the dilution inquiry\n\nunder § 2, see 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b), requires an assessment of the\n\n\"totality of the circumstances.\"            123 S.Ct. at 2511.       One reason\n\nfor this broad factual inquiry, the Court indicated, is that \"[t]he\n\nability of minority voters to elect a candidate of their choice is\n\nimportant    but    often    complex   in   practice     to   determine.\"      Id.\n\nAccordingly, the Court held, influence and crossover districts must\n\nbe considered as part of that determination in the retrogression\n\ncontext.     Id. at 2512.       The Court also cited empirical studies\n\nindicating    that    such    districts     may    maximize    minority     voting\n\nstrength.    Id. at 2512-13.\n\n            We also consider relevant both modern and historical\n\npolitical realities.        During the 1970s and 1980s, African-American\n\npopulations usually could not elect representatives of their choice\n\nunless they constituted a majority in an electoral district.                   See\n\ngenerally Quiet Revolution in the South (C. Davidson & B. Grofman\n\neds., 1994).       Indeed, usually a mere majority was not sufficient;\n\nmany believed that to overcome racial bloc voting patterns, the\n\ntotal   minority      population   needed     to    be   sixty-five    percent.\n\nSee Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1415-16 (7th Cir. 1984)\n\n(collecting sources).         But the percentage of minority population\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fnecessary to elect a candidate has been steadily declining.      By\n\n1990, fifty-five percent was generally considered sufficient.   And\n\nthereafter, due to increased white crossover voting, the number has\n\nslipped below majority level.   One study reported that during the\n\n1990s, an African-American candidate could be elected from a\n\ncongressional district that was between thirty-three and thirty-\n\nnine percent African-American. B. Grofman, L. Handley & D. Lublin,\n\nDrawing Effective Minority Districts: A Conceptual Framework and\n\nSome Empirical Evidence, 79 N.C. L. Rev. 1383, 1407-09 (2001). The\n\npercentage of minority voters necessary to elect a candidate\n\ndepends heavily on the political makeup of the district as a whole,\n\nsee Pildes, supra, at 1535-36, a matter difficult to determine on\n\na motion to dismiss a complaint.\n\n          In sum, it is not an absolute bar to a claim under § 2 of\n\nthe VRA that some amount of crossover voting is needed for a\n\nminority group to elect a candidate of its choice.14   See Armour v.\n\n\n     14\n        Our dissenting colleague engages in the sort of factual\npredictions that courts are forbidden to indulge on a motion to\ndismiss. See Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States, 257 F.3d 31, 37\n(1st Cir. 2001) (refusing to engage in \"speculation\" on appeal from\na Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal and instead assuming the truth of the\naverments in the complaint). The dissent assumes that a minimum\nlevel of crossover voting of 32% will be required for the African-\nAmerican minority to elect a candidate of its choice, and it\nassumes that only two-candidate contests are relevant. It assumes\nthat the African-American voters' inability to elect their\npreferred candidate \"can much more readily be attributed to\ncandidate-specific issues\" than to the reduction in the\nrepresentation of the African-American community in the political\nprocess. It assumes that plaintiffs will establish no history of\ndiscrimination against black citizens in the political process. It\n\n                                -23-\n\fOhio, 775 F. Supp. 1044, 1059-61 (N.D. Ohio 1991) (three-judge\n\ncourt); see also McNeil, 828 A.2d at 852-53; Powers, 263 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 1109-1113 (three-judge court) (Gwin, J., concurring in\n\njudgment); West v. Clinton, 786 F. Supp. 803, 807 & n.2 (W.D. Ark.\n\n1992) (three-judge court).\n\n            Though a claim that includes crossover voting may be\n\ncognizable under the first precondition for a § 2 cause of action,\n\nnot every such claim will pass muster.   It would be discordant with\n\nthe Act, for instance, to consider a crossover district claim from\n\na numerically tiny minority population that can only claim a hope\n\nto elect a candidate with an overwhelming number of crossover\n\nvotes.    Several limiting principles readily present themselves.15\n\n\nassumes that there will not be sufficient bloc voting by Hispanic\nvoters after the redistricting to defeat the African-American\ncommunity's candidate of choice.\n     Further, the dissent assumes that \"whites and Hispanics would\nhave to cast almost half of the votes needed for a successful\nsenatorial candidacy.\"     In a plurality race, as the dissent\napparently concedes, that is almost certainly untrue. Even in a\ntwo-candidate race, it may be untrue -- given, for example, low\noverall voter turnout, high African-American turnout, and African-\nAmerican bloc voting. Similarly, the dissent assumes that a 5%\nreduction in the African-American population is insignificant. But\nthe former African-American state senator may have lost the\nelection by that 5%.\n     Each of these assumptions reflects factual inferences that,\nby law, must be made in plaintiffs' favor on a motion to dismiss.\nUnited States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 114 (1st Cir. 1992).\n     15\n        We reach a determination only with regard to crossover\ndistricts, the sole type of influence claim presented in this\nappeal. We reach no conclusion concerning other types of influence\nclaims, which, if they are recognized, may require a different\napplication of the Gingles preconditions and different limiting\nprinciples.\n\n                                -24-\n\f             First, this case presents a claim not merely of an\n\nabstract hope to elect the African-American voters' preferred\n\ncandidate through both African-American and crossover voting.              The\n\nalleged loss is much more concrete.                Historically, the African-\n\nAmerican community's preferred candidate was consistently elected,\n\neven though African-American voters were less than a numerical\n\nmajority   in    the    district.     The    redistricting    plan,   however,\n\nsignificantly reduced the percentage of African-American voters in\n\nthe district, and the candidate lost his bid for reelection.\n\nAfrican-American voters sued, saying they had been denied an equal\n\nopportunity to elect the candidate of their choice, and on this\n\nmotion to dismiss, the redistricting plan must be taken as the\n\ncause of the lost election.         That is not to say that a history of\n\nelectoral success is a necessary part of a successful claim,\n\nespecially if the lack of success is due to historic vote dilution,\n\nbut the minority group's historical voting success makes this an\n\neasier case.\n\n             The second is the statutory requirement that a minority\n\npopulation      be     able   to    elect,    in     a   potential    district,\n\n\"representatives of their choice.\"            42 U.S.C. 1973(b) (emphasis\n\nsupplied).      A minority group may require so many crossover votes\n\nthat it does not truly have the capacity to choose its own\n\ncandidate, but only to help elect candidates chosen by other\n\ngroups.    If so, plaintiffs cannot make a crossover district claim.\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fHere, however, the plaintiffs clearly plead in their complaint that\n\nthe African-American community can elect its own candidate with\n\ncrossover support in a properly drawn district.\n\n             The      third   limitation     is     expressed      in     the   third\n\nGingles precondition: \"the minority must be able to demonstrate\n\nthat the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it\n\n. . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"                     478\n\nU.S. at 51.        A minority population that is too small, and that\n\ntherefore requires too high a level of crossover support, will not\n\nbe able to meet the third precondition. If the majority population\n\nis    willing    to    provide   crossover        support   to    minority-chosen\n\ncandidates at very high levels, then it cannot be said to be voting\n\nas a bloc against these candidates.                 For the reasons described\n\nbelow,     the   plaintiffs'     complaint    offers    enough      on    the   third\n\nprecondition to render a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on that ground\n\ninappropriate.16\n\n             Finally, we note that this is not a situation, as in\n\nGeorgia v. Ashcroft, supra, where the leaders of the African-\n\nAmerican community developed the redistricting plan at issue.                     The\n\ncontrary is true here.         With only one state senator out of fifty,\n\nthe   African-American        community    had     precious      little    political\n\nstrength in the senate before the redistricting.                   After the plan\n\n\n      16\n       The parties agree that the second Gingles precondition is\nmet by the plaintiffs' pleading that \"African-American voters in\nthe State of Rhode Island are politically cohesive.\"\n\n                                      -26-\n\fwas implemented, they lost their only representation.                   Similarly,\n\nthis is not a case about the failure to maximize potential African-\n\nAmerican voting power.        Cf. Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U.S. 74 (1997).\n\nRather, this is a case about the elimination of African-American\n\nvoters' opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice, an\n\nopportunity     that   they   had   consistently        enjoyed   prior    to    the\n\nredistricting.\n\nD.     Third Precondition: Majority Bloc Voting\n\n            The   third   Gingles     precondition        requires      that    \"the\n\nminority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes\n\nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it               . . . usually to defeat the\n\nminority's preferred candidate.\"          478 U.S. at 51.         Again, this is\n\npart   of   a   functional     approach      to   the   Act.      See    id.    (\"In\n\nestablishing      this    last      circumstance,        the   minority        group\n\ndemonstrates that submergence in a white multimember district\n\nimpedes its ability to elect its chosen representatives.\").                     This\n\ncourt has described the third condition as addressing \"whether the\n\nchallenged practice, procedure, or structure is the cause of the\n\nminority group's inability to mobilize its potential voting power\n\nand elect its preferred candidates,\" Vecinos, 72 F.3d at 980, and\n\nreferred to the bloc simply as a \"majoritarian\" bloc, id. at 981,\n\n982.\n\n            The district court held that the plaintiffs' complaint\n\nfailed to satisfy this third condition.                 First, it read Gingles\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fspecifically to require that the majority bloc must be a white\n\nnumerical majority. While the complaint does not specify the white\n\npopulation of Senate District 2, it can be no more than 31.84%\n\nafter subtracting the African-American and Hispanic population.\n\nFurthermore, the court calculated that because the old district was\n\nonly twenty-six percent African-American, the crossover vote needed\n\nto elect the candidate preferred by African-American voters would\n\nhave to constitute twenty-four percent of the electorate.   If half\n\nof that crossover vote were white, the court reasoned, then the\n\nwhite population would be crossing over at a rate of about one-\n\nthird, which it thought too high to be consistent with \"bloc\n\nvoting\" needed to \"defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"\n\nMetts, 217 F. Supp. 2d at 260-61.\n\n          This reasoning has several flaws.       Inherent in the\n\ncourt's analysis is the assumption that the electoral contest would\n\nhave only two candidates. That is not necessarily so, particularly\n\nin primaries.     In many jurisdictions, the winner of a particular\n\nparty's primary is de facto the winner of the general election; it\n\nmay be inferred that this was historically the case in the old\n\nSenate District 9 and it remains true in the reconfigured Senate\n\nDistrict 2.     The court also allocated the crossover vote half to\n\nwhites and half to Hispanics, but there is simply no evidence of\n\nthe racial composition of the crossover votes, either historically\n\nor in a proposed alternative district.\n\n\n                                -28-\n\f              Further, we reject the district court's impermissible\n\nfocus on only the white voters in Senate District 2 for purposes of\n\nthe   third     Gingles      precondition.          The    plaintiffs,      in     their\n\ncomplaint, claim that \"[t]he white and Hispanic communities vote\n\nsufficiently as a bloc usually to defeat the candidate of choice of\n\nAfrican-American voters when that candidate is African-American and\n\nthe district      is       less   than   twenty-six       percent   black    in    total\n\npopulation.\"     Under the standards of Rule 12(b)(6), such claims in\n\nthe complaint may be rejected only if they are \"bald assertions\" or\n\n\"unsupportable conclusions.\"             Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals, 811 F.2d\n\n36, 37 (1st Cir. 1987).            Neither characterization can be said to be\n\ntrue here.\n\n              The VRA does not, by its terms, afford protection to or\n\nagainst any particular racial or ethnic group; if it did, it might\n\nwell be suspect under the Equal Protection Clause.                        U.S. Const.\n\namend. XIV, § 1.            The language of Gingles referred to a \"white\n\nmajority\" only because that happened to be the composition of the\n\nmajority on the facts before the Court.                   See 478 U.S. at 51.\n\n              Nor must the majority bloc be comprised of only one race.\n\nWhile the \"protected class\" being discriminated against must be\n\nconstituted     of     a    particular    \"race     or    color,\"   see     42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973(a), there is no requirement in the VRA that a contrary\n\nvoting bloc be of just one race.              Coalitions of certain races that\n\ncharacteristically          vote    against   the    preferred      candidate      of   a\n\n\n                                          -29-\n\fdifferent racial group may well constitute bloc voting for purposes\n\nof the third Gingles precondition. In De Grandy, the Supreme Court\n\nconsidered    such   a   challenge    to    Florida's    state    legislative\n\ndistricts.    In one county, there were three large voter groups:\n\nAfrican-Americans, Hispanics, and whites.          The trial court found,\n\nbased on expert testimony, that during elections pitting a minority\n\ncandidate against a white one, the white voters would vote as a\n\nbloc along with the other minority group's voters to elect the\n\nwhite candidate.     De Grandy v. Wetherell, 815 F. Supp. 1550, 1572\n\n(N.D. Fla. 1992) (three-judge court).          The Supreme Court did not\n\nfind this fact pattern problematic as a means to satisfy the third\n\nGingles precondition.     De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1007.           In a similar\n\ncase, also reviewing a challenge to a Florida redistricting plan,\n\nthe Eleventh Circuit found that \"a coalition of Hispanics and Non\n\nLatin Whites could form the relevant majority voting bloc for the\n\npurpose of the third Gingles factor.\"         Meek v. Metro. Dade County,\n\n908 F.2d 1540, 1545-46 (11th Cir. 1990).         We agree.\n\n          The district court's rationale does, however, highlight\n\na potential difficulty with the plaintiffs' complaint.                In the\n\nplaintiffs'   proposed    remedial     district,   the    African-American\n\npopulation would be at least twenty-six percent.           Depending on how\n\nthe facts are developed, that number may raise issues related to\n\nthe third precondition.     If it is true that a majority (rather than\n\nonly a plurality) is needed to elect a candidate, if the racial\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fmakeup of the voters is proportional to the racial composition of\n\nthe district, and if, as the plaintiffs assert, the African-\n\nAmerican voters are politically cohesive, then crossover voting\n\nwould need to reach twenty-four percent. In that scenario, thirty-\n\ntwo percent of the non-African-American voters would have to\n\nsupport the African-American community's chosen candidate in order\n\nto reach the majority needed.        The district court believed that\n\nsuch a high rate of crossover voting would be inconsistent with a\n\nfinding of bloc voting.\n\n          At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, that conclusion is premature.\n\nA series of factual assumptions would be required to judge the\n\naverage level of crossover support the plaintiffs are alleging,\n\nassumptions that cannot be confirmed or repudiated at this stage of\n\nthe   proceedings.    While    the    complaint's   description    of   a\n\nreconfigured district includes total population figures, there is\n\nno demographic information concerning the voting age population,\n\nthe number of registered voters, or the expected voters in any\n\ngiven election, much less the typical voting patterns of various\n\ngroups.   There are also no facts about the number of candidates\n\nthat typically run in the primary or general elections.           Without\n\nsuch information, it is impossible to know the percentage of\n\ncrossover support necessary to elect the candidate of the African-\n\nAmerican community's choice.\n\n          More importantly, even if the facts show that crossover\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fvoting of thirty-two percent would be required, that number,\n\nwithout more, does not warrant a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for\n\nfailure     to    state   a    claim     in      light     of    the    third\n\nGingles precondition.     The statute commands an examination of \"the\n\ntotality of circumstances.\"     42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).        An inquiry into\n\nthe third precondition is thus an inherently factual enterprise.\n\n\"[T]he degree of racial bloc voting that is cognizable as an\n\nelement of a § 2 vote dilution claim will vary according to a\n\nvariety of factual circumstances.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57-58; see\n\nVecinos, 72 F.3d at 989.      The Supreme Court has been chary of per\n\nse rules in this area, whether the claim is that a device is a per\n\nse violation of § 2, Voinovich, 507 U.S. 154, or whether the claim\n\nis that a single factor is a safe harbor for defendants, De Grandy,\n\n512 U.S. at 1017-18.\n\n            One   important   factor     about     which   the   record    is\n\nundeveloped is the pattern of voting behavior over time.               Gingles\n\nstressed the importance of determining whether racial bloc voting\n\nis a pattern extending over time or merely a phenomenon in a single\n\nelection.   478 U.S. at 57.    The reverse is also true: the success\n\nof a minority candidate, or the absence of bloc voting in a few\n\nelections, cannot be taken to mean that the district does not\n\nexperience racial bloc voting overall.           Id.\n\n            Furthermore, a crossover rate of thirty-two percent is\n\nwithin the range of fact patterns in which courts have found\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\fmajority bloc voting.     Gingles itself found majority bloc voting\n\nwhere the majority group supported African-American candidates in\n\nthe general election at a rate between twenty-eight and forty-nine\n\npercent, with an average support of one-third.              Id. at 59; see\n\nCampos v. Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240, 1249 (5th Cir. 1988) (finding\n\nmajority bloc voting when the crossover vote was thirty-seven\n\npercent).    Of course, that does not mean that a crossover rate less\n\nthan one-third would always disprove majority bloc voting: in other\n\ncircumstances,    the   Supreme   Court   has   found   a   crossover   rate\n\naveraging between twenty-two and thirty-eight percent sufficient to\n\nsuggest \"a general willingness of white voters to vote for black\n\ncandidates,\" especially when minority candidates have a record of\n\nsuccess.17    Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U.S. 74, 93 (1997) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n             At this stage of the litigation there is no evidence of\n\nthe degree or effect, if any, of racially polarized voting, or\n\nwhether a voting district could have been constituted to protect\n\nthe ability of both African-American and Hispanic voters to elect\n\ncandidates of their choice.\n\n\n\n     17\n       The dissent's citation to Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U.S. 74,\n92-93 (1997), does not assist it. Abrams was decided after trial\non a full record. The record revealed that there was, over time,\nan increased general willingness of white voters to vote for black\ncandidates, and a corresponding decrease in racial polarization.\nThe Abrams Court did not purport to establish a mathematical litmus\ntest for screening cases under the third Gingles precondition on a\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n                                   -33-\n\f            The dissent misses the point when it objects that the VRA\n\nis not meant \"to ensure the success of candidates favored by\n\nminority groups.\"       In this case, it is undisputed that a minority\n\ngroup's preferred candidate, an incumbent, failed to win reelection\n\nin   the   first   election    after   the    state   legislature       adopted   a\n\nredistricting plan that decreased the percentage representation of\n\nthat minority in the candidate's home electoral district. No court\n\nhas ever held -- and it would be clear error for a court to hold --\n\nthat such a defeat is irrelevant to the question whether members of\n\nthat minority group \"have less opportunity than other members of\n\nthe electorate to participate in the political process and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b). Plaintiffs\n\nseek equality of opportunity, not a guarantee of electoral success.\n\n            The    district    court's       dismissal   of    the     plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to meet the third Gingles\n\nprecondition was inappropriate.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n            Congress,     in   enacting       the   Voting    Rights    Act,   was\n\ncognizant of this country's long and shameful history of excluding\n\nAfrican-Americans from our political processes.                In light of the\n\npurposes of the Fourteenth Amendment and its guarantee of equal\n\nprotection of the laws, it is no answer to say, as the dissent\n\ndoes, that the federal courts should close their doors to possibly\n\nmeritorious complaints under the Voting Rights Act out of deference\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\fto majoritarian will and \"difficult\" legislative choices.           That is\n\nparticularly    true   at   this   early   stage   of   the     litigation.\n\nPlaintiffs must still prove their case; they must establish the\n\nGingles preconditions, as well as a substantive violation of the\n\nVRA, with evidence.    There is no frustration of majoritarian will\n\nin requiring the defendants to respond to allegations that state a\n\nclaim under the Act.   The dissent describes such a claim as a quest\n\nfor \"unfair advantage.\"      To the contrary, the complaint states a\n\nclaim of unfair disadvantage to African-American voters in the\n\nexercise of the most important right in our American democracy. If\n\nplaintiffs ultimately prevail, it will be because they have proven\n\nthat the Rhode Island legislature, acting for the majority, has\n\nviolated the Voting Rights Act by impermissibly denying members of\n\nthe African-American community in Providence an equal opportunity\n\nto elect a state senator of their choice.          As the Supreme Court\n\nstated in Georgia v. Ashcroft, \"[t]he purpose of the Voting Rights\n\nAct is to prevent discrimination in the exercise of the electoral\n\nfranchise and to foster our transformation to a society that is no\n\nlonger fixated on race.\"     123 S.Ct. at 2517.\n\n          The plaintiffs must be given the opportunity to prove\n\ntheir case.    We express no view as to the outcome.          The dismissal\n\nof the plaintiffs' complaint is reversed and the case is remanded\n\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fDissenting opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n           -36-\n\f          SELYA,    Circuit     Judge   (dissenting).         Although   it   is\n\nregrettable that redistricting may make it more difficult for a\n\ncandidate preferred by African-American voters to win election to\n\nthe Rhode Island state senate, the Voting Rights Act is not\n\nintended as a means of ensuring that every minority group has\n\nexactly the district lines that it deems most advantageous. In the\n\ncircumstances of this case, I can discern no valid legal basis for\n\nus to superimpose the appellants' will on that of the Rhode Island\n\nGeneral Assembly.        I would therefore affirm the district court's\n\ndismissal of the amended complaint.\n\n          My reasoning is rooted in precedent.               The Supreme Court\n\nhas made it reasonably clear that, as a threshold requirement for\n\nthe maintenance     of    a   vote   dilution   claim   in    a   single-member\n\ndistrict, plaintiffs must show (1) that they are part of a minority\n\ngroup that is sufficiently large and geographically compact to\n\nconstitute a majority in some plausible iteration of the affected\n\ndistrict; (2) that the group is politically cohesive; and (3) that\n\nother racial groups engage in bloc voting significant enough to\n\ndefeat the minority group's preferred candidate.                  Voinovich v.\n\nQuilter, 507 U.S. 146, 157-158 (1993) (applying Thornburg v.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50-51 (1986), to single-member districts);\n\nGrowe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40 (1993) (same).              Given the nature\n\nof their claim, I think it is fairly clear that the appellants\n\ncannot satisfy the first precondition.            It is absolutely clear,\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\fhowever, that they cannot simultaneously satisfy both the first and\n\nthird preconditions.\n\n          I   start   with   the   first   Gingles   precondition.   The\n\nappellants concede that they are unable to show that African-\n\nAmericans can constitute a literal majority in any plausible\n\niteration of Senate District 2.       Rather, their complaint rests on\n\nthe novel premise that a minority group whose members cannot\n\nconceivably comprise a numerical majority, even in what is from\n\ntheir point of view an ideally configured single-member district,\n\nnonetheless can mount a viable vote dilution claim by demonstrating\n\nthat the district's lines could have been drawn in such a way as to\n\ngive the minority group the ability to elect the candidate its\n\nmembers prefer.   Whether or not this type of claim ever can fall\n\nwithin the purview of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA), 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1973, the instant claim does not. The identified minority\n\ngroup is so small and its need to rely on crossover voting so great\n\nthat the appellants' section 2 claim necessarily fails.\n\n          It is common ground that courts must apply the Gingles\n\npreconditions to the ideal district proposed by those who challenge\n\na redistricting plan.   See Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S. 874, 880 (1994)\n\n(opinion of Kennedy, J.); Negrón v. City of Miami Beach, 113 F.3d\n\n1563, 1571 (11th Cir. 1997).       In this case, the appellants concede\n\nthat the adoption of a constitutional amendment downsizing the\n\nGeneral Assembly required redistricting of the state senate. Thus,\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\fSenate     District      9   could    not    remain       intact     and     had    to    be\n\nreconfigured.        With this in mind, the appellants describe their\n\nideal version of Senate District 2 as a district in which African-\n\nAmericans      comprise      roughly     26%       of    the    population.              This\n\nconfiguration differentiates the appellants' case from the mine-\n\nrun. Typically, vote dilution claims address redistricting schemes\n\nthat take a racial minority group whose members have the potential\n\nto comprise a numerical majority in a geographically compact\n\ndistrict and disperse the group across two or more districts (with\n\nthe result that its members constitute a majority in none).                               See\n\nVoinovich, 507 U.S. at 153.\n\n              My colleagues suggest that we can change the paradigm\n\nbecause the appellants may have been deprived of a \"crossover\n\ndistrict\" — a kind of \"influence district\" in which a numerical\n\nminority      is   so    positioned    that    it       has    an   ability    to    swing\n\nelections.         See generally id. at 154 (describing an influence\n\ndistrict as one in which minority group members \"could not dictate\n\nelectoral outcomes independently [but] could elect their candidate\n\nof   choice    nonetheless     if     they    are   numerous        enough    and    their\n\ncandidate attracts sufficient cross-over votes from white voters\").\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly refrained from deciding the\n\ncognizability       of    claims     based    on    legislative       dismantling         of\n\ncrossover districts, e.g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997,\n\n1008-09 (1994); Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 154, and, until today, this\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fcourt has exhibited the same restraint, e.g., Vecinos de Barrio Uno\n\nv. City of Holyoke, 72 F.3d 973, 979 n.2 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            To be sure, the preservation of influence or crossover\n\ndistricts may constitute a relevant factor in defending against a\n\nvote dilution claim.              See, e.g., De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1020;\n\nVecinos, 72 F.3d at 990-91 & n.13; Latino Political Action Comm. v.\n\nCity of Boston, 784 F.2d 409, 414-15 (1st Cir. 1986).                    But to say\n\nthat a court may consider crossover districts in deferring to a\n\nstate's redistricting plan is very different from saying that a\n\nminority has the legal right, under section 2 of the VRA, to demand\n\nthat the legislature establish such a district.                 The ultimate goal\n\nof the VRA is \"transition to a society where race no longer\n\nmatters.\"        Georgia v. Ashcroft, 123 S. Ct. 2498, 2517 (2003).\n\nThus, minorities still bear the burden \"to pull, haul, and trade to\n\nfind common political ground, the virtue of which is not to be\n\nslighted in applying a statute meant to hasten the waning of racism\n\nin American politics.\"        Id. at 2512 (quoting De Grandy, 512 U.S. at\n\n1020) (internal quotations marks omitted).                My colleagues' freshly\n\nminted \"functional         approach\"      would    significantly       lighten   this\n\nburden.\n\n            In all events, deciding this case does not require us to\n\ngo   so   far    as   to   rule    out   all    section   2   claims    based    on   a\n\nlegislature's failure either to assemble or to preserve a crossover\n\ndistrict.       Here, the raw numbers are inimical to such a claim.               The\n\n\n                                         -40-\n\fpertinent     demographic        for     analysis     of    the    first      Gingles\n\nprecondition is the voting age population.                 See Growe, 507 U.S. at\n\n38 n.4; Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1412-13 (7th Cir. 1984).\n\nIn   this   case,    the   appellants      maintain     that     African-Americans\n\nrepresented approximately 26% of the voting age population in\n\nformer Senate District 9 yet represent only 21% of the voting age\n\npopulation in the new district (Senate District 2).                      They claim\n\nthat this 5% differential is a political kiss of death.\n\n             Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, the appellants' thesis\n\nproceeds along the following lines. Whenever a candidate preferred\n\nby African-Americans runs for the state senate in the new district,\n\nhe or she will receive all the African-American votes plus no less\n\nthan 32% but no more than 37% of the combined white and Hispanic\n\nvotes (these being the percentages of all white and Hispanic voters\n\nnecessary to form a majority in conjunction with African-American\n\nvoters     when   African-Americans       constitute       26%    and   21%     of   the\n\npopulation,       respectively).18        In    the   appellants'       view,    those\n\ncrossover     voters    will     favor    the   African-Americans'         preferred\n\ncandidate    regardless     of    the    race   or    politics     of   his     or   her\n\nopponent(s).       Consequently, the redistricting plan is vulnerable\n\nunder section 2 of the VRA because the electorate's polarization is\n\n\n\n      18\n       This estimate is conservative. To the extent that voter\nregistration or voter turnout differs, or that African-Americans\nare not completely monolithic in their voting preferences, the\nneeded thresholds become harder to achieve.\n\n                                         -41-\n\fso   deeply    entrenched    that   candidate-specific     variations   will\n\noperate only within a 5% margin.\n\n              Whether viewed as a matter of logic, political science,\n\nor   human     behavior,    this    prediction   strikes   me   as   utterly\n\nconjectural.      For good reason, a difference of a few percentage\n\npoints in the minority population of a single-member district\n\ngenerally has been thought unlikely to affect election outcomes.\n\nSee S. Christian Leadership Conf. v. Sessions, 56 F.3d 1281, 1296\n\n(11th Cir. 1995) (en banc).          The appellant's claim flies in the\n\nteeth of this conventional wisdom — and the mere fact that one very\n\npopular candidate, running uphill, had a series of successes in the\n\n\"old\" district does not validate the appellants' claim.\n\n              Even if I must indulge the claim because the district\n\ncourt chose to act at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the most that can be\n\nsaid is that the appellants had forged a sort of functional\n\nmajority in former Senate District 9.        By that I mean that African-\n\nAmericans, though neither numerous nor concentrated enough to\n\ncomprise a majority in the district, exhibited an ability to elect\n\na particularly appealing candidate with the aid of a large and\n\npredictable non-African-American crossover vote.           But whatever may\n\nbe said for functional majority claims in general, the appellants'\n\nfunctional majority claim is a non-starter.            Where, as here, a\n\nminority group comprises only a relatively small fraction of the\n\ntotal population of an electoral district before redistricting, the\n\n\n                                     -42-\n\finability of group members to elect the candidate of their choice\n\nafter    redistricting       can   much    more    readily   be   attributed    to\n\ncandidate-specific issues than to a slight reduction in their\n\nnumbers.     In all events, a minority group of that modest size must\n\nrely    so   heavily    on   crossover      votes,    both   before   and    after\n\nredistricting, that section 2 of the VRA provides no safe harbor.\n\n             The figures tell the tale.           In the appellants' idealized\n\ndistrict, whites and Hispanics would have to cast almost half of\n\nthe votes needed for a successful senatorial candidacy.                      Those\n\nvotes would not correlate with the individual voter's race, but,\n\nrather, with the race of the candidate, or, alternatively, with the\n\nrace of the minority group members with whom the crossover voters\n\nidentify.     This fact has two important implications.             In the first\n\nplace, it confirms that, regardless of how the district's lines are\n\ndrawn, African-Americans by themselves do not have anything close\n\nto an ability to elect the candidate of their choice.                       In the\n\nsecond place, it demonstrates that the appellants' claim puts the\n\nemphasis not on assuring equal opportunity for minority voters but\n\non     assuring   a    victory     by     the   African-Americans'    preferred\n\ncandidate.     That is the wrong emphasis.            See 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b)\n\n(identifying \"members of a class of citizens,\" not candidates, as\n\nthe operative unit of statutory protection); see also De Grandy,\n\n512 U.S. at 1014 n.11 (explaining that \"the ultimate right of § 2\n\nis equality of opportunity, not a guarantee of electoral success\");\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\fSmith v. Brunswick County Bd. of Supervisors, 984 F.2d 1393, 1400\n\n(4th Cir. 1993) (abjuring classification of protected groups by the\n\nway they vote rather than by their race; to do otherwise would\n\nimpermissibly \"resolv[e] discrimination issues on the basis of\n\nwhether members of the protected group are elected\"); cf. Gingles,\n\n478 U.S. at 99-100 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (agreeing that, for\n\npurposes of a section 2 claim, voting must correlate with the race\n\nof the voter).\n\n          The existence of this misdirected emphasis is borne out\n\nby the fact that the appellants' proposed reconfiguration of Senate\n\nDistrict 2 would strengthen the electoral power not only of the\n\nAfrican-American community but also of the sizable white and\n\nHispanic crossover vote. That increased political clout would come\n\nat the expense of the remaining two-thirds of the white and\n\nHispanic voters.    The VRA empowers courts to protect the rights of\n\na minority group to participate in the electoral process so that\n\nsuch a group, if treated fairly, can become a majority.             It does\n\nnot give courts the raw power to privilege the interests of the few\n\nover the interests of the many, much less the power to override the\n\nnormal functioning of the majoritarian process.          See Vecinos, 72\n\nF.3d at 982; Smith, 984 F.2d at 1400-02.\n\n          The    democratic   system   remains   the   best   and   fairest\n\nelectoral system ever devised. Even so, the realities of democracy\n\nare sometimes harsh.   The appellants seek to avoid these realities\n\n\n                                  -44-\n\fby tempting us to treat crossover voters as if they constitute part\n\nof a protected minority within the purview of section 2.             Fidelity\n\nto core democratic values demands that we resist this temptation.\n\nWhile the Gingles preconditions contemplate a certain degree of\n\ncrossover voting, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56; Jenkins v. Red Clay\n\nConsol. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 4 F.3d 1103, 1123 (3d Cir. 1993),\n\nthere is a point at which crossover voting becomes so large a part\n\nof the picture as to crowd out the possibility of a legally\n\ncognizable vote dilution claim.\n\n          That is the picture painted by the amended complaint.\n\nWhere, as in this case, the bricolage comprises a roughly equal mix\n\nof minority and crossover voters, allowing a vote dilution claim to\n\ngo forward would make sense only if the end game were to ensure the\n\nsuccess of candidates favored by minority groups.              As I already\n\nhave explained, however, that is not the objective of the VRA.            Nor\n\nshould it be; my colleagues' \"functional approach\" would create a\n\ntopsy-turvy   world   in   which   legislatures       would   have   to   base\n\nredistricting   plans   not   on   the    need   to   preserve   legitimate\n\nmajority/minority districts, but, rather, on guesswork about the\n\nway in which each constituent was likely to vote.19\n\n\n     19\n        My colleagues write that \"[i]n this case, it is undisputed\nthat a minority group's preferred candidate, an incumbent, failed\nto win reelection in the first election after the state legislature\nadopted a redistricting plan that decreased the percentage\nrepresentation of that minority in the candidate's home electoral\ndistrict.\" Maj. Op. at 34. That is not a relevant consideration.\nWhen the appellants served their amended complaint (May 14, 2002)\n\n                                   -45-\n\f               In short, I do not believe that section 2 of the VRA\n\nauthorizes vote dilution claims that are wholly dependent upon\n\nmassive crossover voting.                There is a critical distinction between\n\nminority-preferred              candidates       who     lose      because    redistricting\n\nexcludes too much of the minority electorate from a particular\n\ndistrict (illegal vote dilution) and minority-preferred candidates\n\nwho lose because they do not attract enough votes from other folks\n\nwithin    the       district      (legal     majoritarian           rule).      The    amended\n\ncomplaint, even when taken at face value, blurs this distinction.\n\n               My    colleagues         attempt     to      blunt    the     force    of   this\n\nreasoning in two ways. First, they posit that vote dilution claims\n\nmust be decided based on the totality of the circumstances.                                That\n\nis so — but the statutory provision they cite, 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b),\n\ndoes     not    inoculate         all     such     claims       against      Rule     12(b)(6)\n\nchallenges.          A    plaintiff       class     must     do     more   than      cry   \"vote\n\ndilution\"       to    engage       the     gears       of    the    VRA.       The     Gingles\n\npreconditions act as a sentry at the gates — a bright-line rule\n\nthat must be satisfied before the totality of the circumstances\n\ncomes into play.                See Valdespino v. Alamo Heights Indep. Sch.\n\nDist., 168 F.3d 848, 852 (5th Cir. 1999) (collecting cases); City\n\nof Carrollton Branch of N.A.A.C.P. v. Stallings, 829 F.2d 1547,\n\n1550-51    (11th         Cir.    1987).      This       framework      helps      ensure    the\n\n\n\nand when the district court dismissed the case (September 9, 2002),\nno elections had yet been held under the redistricting plan.\n\n                                             -46-\n\feffectiveness of the remedy created by the VRA without distorting\n\neither its scope or intent.\n\n           My colleagues' second gambit is to stress that Rhode\n\nIsland elects its state senators under what amounts to a plurality\n\nsystem.   This seems to me to be a bit of a red herring.   On the one\n\nhand, cases holding plaintiffs to the requirements of the first\n\nGingles precondition despite the existence of a plurality election\n\nsystem are ubiquitous.20   See, e.g., Perez v. Pasadena Indep. Sch.\n\nDist., 165 F.3d 368, 370-71 (5th Cir. 1999); Stabler v. County of\n\nThurston, 129 F.3d 1015, 1025 (8th Cir. 1997); Cane v. Worcester\n\nCounty, 35 F.3d 921, 924 n.4, 925 (4th Cir. 1994); McNeil v.\n\nSpringfield Park Dist., 851 F.2d 937, 943-44 (7th Cir. 1988).     On\n\nthe other hand, cases in which courts have recognized a section 2\n\nclaim by members of a small minority group simply because they\n\nreside in a jurisdiction that employs a plurality election system\n\nare nonexistent.    Moreover, plurality election rules are, as my\n\ncolleagues apparently concede, more responsive to minority voters\n\nthan simple majority election rules.    It would be ironic to relax\n\nthe first Gingles precondition for vote dilution claims arising\n\n\n     20\n        Given the widespread popularity of plurality election\nsystems, the Supreme Court must certainly have taken their\nexistence into account in formulating the Gingles preconditions.\nCf. Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 157 (applying the Gingles preconditions\nwithout making any allowance for Ohio's use of a plurality voting\nsystem). I therefore see no reason why we should not adhere to the\nSupreme Court's rendition of the first Gingles precondition without\nengaging in rank speculation about the possibility of multiple\ncandidacies.\n\n                                -47-\n\funder an electoral structure already more favorable to minorities.\n\nIt also would make little sense, politically or mathematically, to\n\nproclaim that a plurality rule supports a minority group's ability\n\nto elect when its members number 26% of the electorate yet utterly\n\nforecloses that ability when they number 21% of the electorate.\n\n              Last — but far from least — my colleagues' reliance on\n\nthe    existence     of    a     plurality     election      system   ignores     the\n\nvicissitudes of such systems.           For example, in elections in which\n\nonly two candidates are on the ballot or in which one of several\n\ncandidates enjoys great popularity, minorities will have to muster\n\na clear majority of all votes cast in order to elect the candidate\n\nof their choice.       The permutations are endless.              To my mind, this\n\nmeans that the putative effects of a plurality voting system are\n\nsimply too speculative to provide a basis for a convincing vote\n\ndilution claim.      See Brewer v. Ham, 876 F.2d 448, 455-56 (5th Cir.\n\n1989); McNeil, 851 F.2d at 944.          These problems may explain why the\n\nappellants     never      made    reference    to    Rhode    Island's   plurality\n\nelection laws in their amended complaint or their appellate briefs.\n\n              That ends this aspect of the matter.             While I am willing\n\nto    leave   open   the    possibility       that   a   racial    minority     group\n\nconstituting less than 50% of the electorate in a particular\n\nsingle-member district may in special circumstances satisfy the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -48-\n\ffirst Gingles precondition,21 the facts alleged in this case reflect\n\nno such special circumstances.         I conclude, therefore, that the\n\nappellants' claim does not and cannot satisfy the first Gingles\n\nprecondition.\n\n          If more were needed — and I doubt that it is — the\n\nappellants'     claim   also   fails   to   satisfy   the   third   Gingles\n\nprecondition.    That precondition requires a showing of nonminority\n\nbloc voting (which, for purposes of this case, encompasses the\n\ncombined voting power of whites and Hispanics).              Here, such a\n\nshowing is inconsistent with the theme around which the appellants'\n\ncase is constructed.\n\n          The appellants showcase Senator Walton's past electoral\n\nsuccesses as proof of the cogency of their ability to elect claim\n\n— but this is a two-edged sword.        Consistent electoral success on\n\nthe part of a racial or ethnic minority group that comprises\n\nconsiderably less than a numerical majority of the electorate is\n\nindicative of the absence of nonminority bloc voting and, thus, is\n\npresumptively inconsistent with the third Gingles precondition.\n\n\n     21\n       Such a situation may occur, for example, where evidence of\nintentional vote dilution exists, e.g., Garza v. County of Los\nAngeles, 918 F.2d 763, 770-72 (9th Cir. 1990); Armour v. Ohio, 775\nF. Supp. 1044, 1060-62 (N.D. Ohio 1991), or a minority group\ncomprises nearly 50% of the population of a particular district,\ne.g., Martinez v. Bush, 234 F. Supp. 2d 1275, 1299 (S.D. Fla. 2002)\n(three-judge court) (per curiam), or the demographic trend lines\nare such that the affected minority group reasonably can be\nexpected to attain majority status in the near future, e.g.,\nSolomon v. Liberty County, 899 F.2d 1012, 1018 n.7 (11th Cir. 1990)\n(en banc) (Kravitch, J., specially concurring).\n\n                                   -49-\n\fSee Gingles, 478 U.S. at 102 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see also\n\nS. Christian Leadership Conf., 56 F.3d at 1291-94 (finding no white\n\nbloc voting where African-Americans, though less than a numerical\n\nmajority, had been largely successful in electing their preferred\n\ncandidates); Overton v. City of Austin, 871 F.2d 529, 540 (5th Cir.\n\n1989) (per curiam) (similar); see also Brooks v. Miller, 158 F.3d\n\n1230, 1241 (11th Cir. 1998) (noting that claims dependent on\n\nsubstantial white crossover voting are inherently inconsistent with\n\nfulfillment of the third Gingles precondition); Turner v. Arkansas,\n\n784 F. Supp. 553, 570-71 (E.D. Ark. 1991) (three-judge court)\n\n(similar). This line of cases reflects a common-sense proposition:\n\nthat the ability of a racial minority group actually to elect its\n\npreferred candidate may depend upon such a high degree of crossover\n\nvoting that the third Gingles precondition inevitably fails of\n\nsatisfaction.   So it is here:      the appellants' reliance on a high\n\nlevel of crossover voting, ranging upward from a minimum of 32% and\n\nnearly    equalling   the   whole    of    the   African-American   vote,\n\ndefenestrates their claim of illegal vote dilution.22\n\n\n\n\n     22\n       The appellants' argument necessarily presupposes that this\ncrossover voting peaks at a point below 37%.    That is a purely\narbitrary figure and, as such, need not be credited (even for\npurposes of a motion to dismiss). See, e.g., Dartmouth Review v.\nDartmouth Coll., 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989) (warning that\ncourts should be wary of \"unsupported conclusions, subjective\ncharacterizations, and problematic suppositions\" when reviewing\ndismissal orders under Rule 12(b)(6)).\n\n                                    -50-\n\f             The appellants — and my colleagues — cite a few cases\n\nsuggesting (or so they say) that a high rate of crossover voting\n\ndoes not necessarily preclude a finding of racially polarized\n\nvoting.     See, e.g., Gingles, 478 U.S. at 59-61 (upholding lower\n\ncourt's finding of white bloc voting despite white crossover voting\n\nranging from 8% to 50%); Campos v. City of Baytown, 840 F.2d 1240,\n\n1249 (5th Cir. 1988) (upholding lower court's finding of white bloc\n\nvoting despite the fact that 3% to 37% of whites crossed over).\n\nBut all of these cases addressed multi-member or at-large districts\n\n— situations that pose a much more subtle threat to minority\n\nelectoral strength precisely because they require higher levels of\n\ncrossover voting for minorities to prevail.23         See Growe, 507 U.S.\n\nat 40; Cane, 35 F.3d at 926; see also S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 29\n\n(1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 206.           In the realm of\n\nchallenges    to    single-member    redistricting    plans,   no   less   an\n\nauthority    than    the   Supreme   Court   has   held   average   majority\n\ncrossover voting of 22% to 38% sufficient to demonstrate the\n\n\"general willingness of [majority] voters to vote for [minority]\n\n\n     23\n       The appellants do cite one case, Old Person v. Cooney, 230\nF.3d 1113 (9th Cir. 2000), that involves single-member districts.\nThere, the Ninth Circuit found white bloc voting because white\nvoting in excess of 60% defeated minority candidates in most\nelections. Id. at 1124-27. That case was not decided based on the\nrate of crossover voting, but, rather, on the regularity with which\nthe white majority had banded together to defeat minority\ncandidates. See id. at 1127-28 (distinguishing Abrams v. Johnson,\n521 U.S. 74, 92-93 (1997), on that very ground). For that reason,\nthe Ninth Circuit never specified what rate of crossover voting\nactually existed.\n\n                                     -51-\n\fcandidates,\"   particularly      in    conjunction      with   a    record    of\n\nsignificant success by minority candidates. Abrams v. Johnson, 521\n\nU.S. 74, 92-93 (1997) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); cf. Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 151-52, 158 (approving lower\n\ncourt's finding of no majority bloc voting where \"black candidates\n\nhave been repeatedly elected from [single-member] districts with\n\nonly a 35% black population\").\n\n          To be sure, the appellants asseverate that their past\n\nvictories occurred only because the \"old\" district (in which\n\nAfrican-Americans comprised approximately 26% of the population)\n\nwas different than the \"new\" district (in which African-Americans\n\ncomprise approximately 21% of the population).              But this modest\n\nchange in the level of African-American penetration does not render\n\nthe voters' track record irrelevant. Whatever the precise numbers,\n\nAfrican-Americans were and are a numerical minority in the district\n\n— and the appellants are in effect arguing that whenever crossover\n\nvoting is large enough to secure the success of a minority-\n\npreferred candidate, that crossover voting cannot be used to\n\ndisprove nonminority bloc voting.            Such a rule would conflict with\n\nboth the realities of modern politics and the objectives of section\n\n2.   The better rule is that when African-Americans constitute a\n\nrelatively   small   numerical   minority        yet   repeatedly   attract    a\n\ncrossover vote sizable enough to elect their preferred candidate,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -52-\n\fthat fact is highly relevant to (and, as here, may be conclusive\n\nin) an analysis of the third Gingles precondition.\n\n           In a final effort to salvage the vote dilution claim, my\n\ncolleagues posit that we cannot make any determinations as to the\n\nthird   Gingles    precondition   until   we   have   evidence   of   voter\n\nregistration, turnout, and voting patterns.       That might ordinarily\n\nbe true — but the appellants have not presented us with an ordinary\n\nvote dilution claim.    Rather, they make a very specific and highly\n\nidiosyncratic claim premised on the notion that at least 32% of the\n\nwhite and Hispanic population can be expected regularly to cross\n\nover in order to form the majority required by the first Gingles\n\nprecondition. This approach inextricably intertwines the first and\n\nthird Gingles preconditions, so that allowances given as to one\n\nnecessarily have repercussions as to the other.           See Sanchez v.\n\nColorado, 97 F.3d 1303, 1315 (10th Cir. 1996) (remarking the\n\ninterrelatedness of these preconditions); Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1133\n\nn.32 (same).      That is one reason why this case cannot survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n           Although \"the degree of racial bloc voting that is\n\ncognizable as an element of a § 2 vote dilution claim will vary\n\naccording to a variety of factual circumstances,\" Gingles, 478 U.S.\n\nat 57-58, the touchstone of the third Gingles precondition is\n\nwhether the majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it to\n\ndefeat the minority's preferred candidate most of the time.             See\n\n\n                                  -53-\n\fid. at 56; Sanchez, 97 F.3d at 1319.           Crossover voting in South\n\nProvidence enabled African-American voters regularly to elect the\n\ncandidate of their choice despite the relatively small African-\n\nAmerican constituency in the predecessor district.             This is a\n\ntelling bit of political history.         See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56\n\n(noting that the amount of nonminority bloc voting that is legally\n\nsignificant varies in part with the size of the minority group\n\nwithin the district); Rangel v. Morales, 8 F.3d 242, 245 (5th Cir.\n\n1993) (same).    It demonstrates to my satisfaction that no legally\n\ncognizable   anti-minority    bloc    voting   exists   here   (and   that,\n\ntherefore, the appellants have failed to meet the third Gingles\n\nprecondition).\n\n            I give the majority its due.        In the ordinary course,\n\ndistrict courts should allow colorable vote dilution claims to\n\nproceed beyond the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.         And, moreover, if one is\n\nwilling to split an infinite number of hairs, it always will be\n\npossible to conjure up remote scenarios that might be disinterred\n\nduring discovery (and, thus, prevent the entry of a motion to\n\ndismiss).    But Rule 12(b)(6) does not invite courts to engage in\n\nsuch endless conjecture.     See Garrett v. Tandy Corp., 295 F.3d 94,\n\n105 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"The method of Rule 12(b)(6) requires courts\n\n. . . to resolve all realistic possibilities in the pleader's\n\nfavor.\" (emphasis supplied)).        Some cases are sufficiently clear\n\nthat, on any rational view of the facts alleged, a vote dilution\n\n\n                                 -54-\n\fclaim is insupportable. See Mixson v. Ohio, 193 F.3d 389, 399-400,\n\n406-08 (6th Cir. 1999) (affirming dismissal of section 2 claim\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6)); Mirrione v. Anderson, 717 F.2d 743, 746 (2d\n\nCir. 1983) (similar); Martinez v. Bush, 234 F. Supp. 2d 1275, 1280\n\nn.7 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (three-judge court) (per curiam) (granting\n\ndefendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion with respect to a section 2\n\nclaim).   This is such a case:    the allegations are unapologetic,\n\nthe key facts are essentially undisputed, and the amended complaint\n\nstands or falls on the cogency of the appellants' avant-garde legal\n\ntheory.   Like the district court, I find that theory unacceptable.\n\n             I add a coda.   Reapportionment and redistricting are\n\nthorny matters —    and matters in which state legislatures are best\n\nsuited to lead.      Within wide limits, courts ought to respect\n\nlegislative choices. See Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 156-57 (collecting\n\ncases).   I understand that respect is not equivalent to blind\n\nallegiance, and if there were signs that the Rhode Island General\n\nAssembly had acted in derogation of the Constitution or federal\n\nlaw, I would not hesitate to support judicial intervention.     But\n\nsuch signs are lacking here, so respect counsels restraint.\n\n           Given the mixed racial and ethnic composition of South\n\nProvidence, the Rhode Island General Assembly was caught between a\n\nrock and a hard place.   It made a series of difficult choices, not\n\nperfectly, but within the compass of its legal and constitutional\n\nauthority.     Whether or not I would have drawn the lines of the\n\n\n                                 -55-\n\faffected district in the same manner is beside the point.            What\n\nmatters is that the General Assembly's line-drawing is a product of\n\nlegitimate    legislative   choices   made   within   allowable   limits.\n\nAccepting the appellants' vote dilution claim would nullify these\n\nchoices and give an unfair advantage to a particular subset of\n\nvoters — an advantage beyond any that Congress contemplated in\n\ndrafting the VRA. In the bargain, accepting the claim would shrink\n\nthe   district-wide   Hispanic   population,   thereby   disadvantaging\n\nanother group of minority voters.\n\n             I have said my piece.    Because the appellants fail to\n\nallege the kind of impermissibly race-based distortion of electoral\n\nopportunity that would sustain a claim under section 2 of the VRA,\n\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -56-\n\f",

A group of African-American voters\n\nand related organizations brought a challenge under § 2 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (2000), to the Rhode Island\n\nstate senate redistricting plan adopted in 2002.     They allege that\n\nalthough African-Americans did not constitute a numerical majority\n\nin any state senate district before redistricting, they have\n\nhistorically had the ability to elect a representative of their\n\nchoice with the help of crossover votes in one of the former\n\ndistricts.    They claim that as a result of the redistricting plan,\n\nthis opportunity has been adversely affected (indeed, eliminated)\n\nby the reduction of the African-American percentage in the relevant\n\ndistrict.     After the districts were redrawn, their candidate of\n\nchoice, at that time an incumbent, lost his seat in the Democratic\n\nParty primary.      Because of the makeup of the newly configured\n\ndistrict, the victor in the primary was effectively assured of\n\nbeing the victor in the general election.1\n\n             The district court dismissed the claim under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(b)(6) because the African-American group could not form a\n\nnumerical majority in any district and because that group would\n\nrequire crossover votes to elect a candidate of its choice.     Under\n\n\n     1\n       While the loss of the incumbent, Charles D. Walton, in\nSenate District 9 is not part of the plaintiffs' complaint, we take\njudicial notice of this electoral outcome. The fact of his loss is\nundisputed and has been referred to by the parties.

Thus, the following facts are\n\nderived from the plaintiffs' amended complaint.\n\n               On February 23, 2002, the Rhode Island General Assembly\n\nvoted to pass a redistricting plan for the state senate.                      An\n\nalteration was necessary for two reasons.               First, there was a need\n\nto adjust the senate districts to account for shifts in state\n\npopulation.        Second,   a    recent     state    constitutional    amendment\n\nreduced the number of senate districts from fifty to thirty-eight,\n\nnecessitating an entirely new district map with larger districts.\n\n               The new senate district plan was highly controversial.\n\nThere were concerns from the beginning that the plan might make it\n\nmore difficult for African-American voters to elect candidates of\n\ntheir choice.       Various community groups and individuals testified\n\nbefore the legislature against the plan on the grounds that it\n\nwould not give African-American voters \"an equal opportunity to\n\nelect candidates of their choice\" to the state senate, and that the\n\nplan unnecessarily abridged the voting rights of African-American\n\nvoters    in    violation    of   the    VRA.      Nonetheless,   the   senate's\n\njudiciary committee \"approved the plan[] without taking the time to\n\nevaluate the proposals and comments of those opposed to the plan.\"\n\nIt is fair to infer, given that there was only one African-American\n\nsenator, that the plan was approved over the objections of the\n\nAfrican-American      community        and   its   representative.       Governor\n\nLincoln    Almond     refused     to    sign    the   legislation,     explicitly\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fquestioning its fairness to Rhode Island's minority populations.\n\nHe did not veto it, however, and the plan became law without his\n\nsignature on February 23, 2002.\n\n          The population of Rhode Island is four percent African-\n\nAmerican,4 over half of whom live in Providence.                 The state's\n\nAfrican-American citizens continue to suffer from past official\n\ndiscrimination in housing, education, health care, and employment.\n\nBy   common   measures   of    socio-economic      status,       educational\n\nattainment, and access to political resources, they continue to lag\n\nbehind the rest of the state.          Only one African-American state\n\nsenator, the chosen candidate of the African-American community,\n\nhas ever been elected in Rhode Island; that senator, Charles D.\n\nWalton,   represented    the   old     Senate   District     9    until   the\n\nredistricting.   According to the census data from the year 2000,\n\nthat district was 25.69% African-American and 41.08% Hispanic.\n\nMuch of Providence's African-American population is now within the\n\nnew Senate District 2.     The population of this new district is\n\n21.42% African-American and 46.74% Hispanic, and the voting age\n\npopulation is 21.43% African-American and 43.12% Hispanic.5\n\n\n     4\n       The complaint makes a distinction between Hispanic voters\nand \"Non-Hispanic African-American\" voters.      We use \"African-\nAmerican\" to describe the latter group, as distinguished from\nHispanic African-Americans, whom the complaint counts as members of\nthe Hispanic community.\n     5\n       The complaint does not specify the voting age population\ndemographics of the old Senate District 9, nor does it specify the\npercentage of the population that is white in either the old Senate\n\n                                     -6-\n\f           Plaintiffs plead that the African-American voters in\n\nRhode Island are themselves politically cohesive, and that they are\n\nnot   cohesive   with   Hispanic    or    white   voters.   Although   no\n\nalternative plans were appended to the complaint, plaintiffs claim\n\nthat it is possible to divide the state into thirty-eight districts\n\nsuch that one senate district would have a population that is at\n\nleast twenty-six percent African-American, and in such a district\n\nit would be possible for \"an African-American candidate preferred\n\nby African-American voters\" to win election due to white and\n\nHispanic crossover support.        However, if a district is less than\n\ntwenty-six percent African-American, \"[t]he white and Hispanic\n\ncommunities vote sufficiently in a bloc usually to defeat the\n\ncandidate of choice of African-American voters.\"\n\n                                    II.\n\n           Without filing a responsive pleading, the defendants\n\nquickly moved to dismiss on the basis of Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)\n\nfor failure to state a claim.

The Gingles court established\n\nthree \"preconditions\" for a VRA challenge to multimember districts.\n\n          First, the minority group must be able to demonstrate\n          that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact\n          to constitute a majority in a single-member district. .\n          . .

As a matter of pleading, the\n\ncomplaint explicitly pleads the second and third of the Gingles\n\npreconditions as well as geographic compactness under the first\n\nprecondition.\n\n          This is not a case, as in De Grandy, where minority\n\nvoters hold a majority in some districts and the issue is whether\n\n§ 2 of the VRA requires courts to maximize the number of districts\n\n                                    -10-\n\fin which minority voters may elect their candidates of choice.\n\nHere, the only district in which African-American voters could\n\nelect a candidate of their choice (with help from crossover voting)\n\nwas altered significantly; the result, plaintiffs say, is that\n\nAfrican-American voters can no longer elect a candidate of their\n\nchoice in any state senatorial district. Far from complaining that\n\nthe legislature has failed to maximize their political power, these\n\nplaintiffs complain that their opportunity to elect a candidate of\n\ntheir choice has been minimized -- indeed, eliminated.\n\nC.   First Precondition: Compactness & Numerousness\n\n          1.    Ability to Influence and Crossover Voting\n\n          The district court characterized plaintiffs' claim as\n\nalternately an \"ability to influence\" claim and an \"ability to\n\nelect\" claim.        The   Gingles Court,    when   fashioning    the   three\n\npreconditions   to    a    redistricting    challenge   to   a   multimember\n\ndistrict, expressly reserved the question of whether § 2 permitted\n\nclaims by a minority group \"alleging that the use of a multimember\n\ndistrict impairs its ability to influence elections,\" and whether\n\nthe three preconditions would apply unabated to such a claim.             478\n\nU.S. at 46 n.12 (emphasis in original).         The same question of the\n\nmeaning of an ability to elect as opposed to an ability to\n\ninfluence arises in challenges to single member districts.              See De\n\nGrandy, 512 U.S. at 1008-09; Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 154.\n\n          Since Gingles, there has been much confusion over the\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fdefinition of an influence claim under the VRA.                        Most often,\n\ninfluence districts have been defined as ones \"in which a minority\n\ngroup has enough political heft to exert significant influence on\n\nthe   choice    of     candidate   though   not    enough      to   determine   that\n\nchoice.\"    Barnett v.

They use the term \"influence district\" in the complaint\n\nto describe what we label a crossover district, in which African-\n\nAmerican voters have an ability to elect with crossover support.\n\nWe consider only this type of influence claim, and not the more\n\nnebulous variety described in Barnett and disavowed by plaintiffs.\n\n              The Supreme Court has expressly held open the question\n\nof whether the Gingles preconditions should apply to influence\n\nclaims.

We read the language of these\n\ncases, especially Gingles and Voinovich, to profess a willingness\n\nto consider a crossover district claim such as the one plaintiffs\n\nplead.     The Gingles language setting aside the question of an\n\ninfluence claim did not differentiate between crossover district\n\nclaims and claims in which plaintiffs profess only an ability to\n\naffect, not determine, electoral outcomes.           But the Court has not\n\nflatly    refused    to   consider   a   crossover   district    despite   the\n\nopportunity to do so.

Despite the differences\n\nbetween § 2 and § 5 analysis, the Court's treatment of influence\n\nand crossover districts in Georgia is highly instructive.\n\n          Georgia held that when assessing retrogression, courts\n\nmust consider not only majority-minority districts but also the\n\nexistence of influence districts, including crossover districts.\n\n123 S.Ct. at 2512.     The state's plan created two additional\n\ndistricts with a minority population of between thirty and fifty\n\npercent, and two districts with a population of between twenty-five\n\nand thirty percent. These districts, the Court found, were crucial\n\nto determining the overall effect of the new redistricting plan.\n\nId. at 2515.    Indeed, the Court was unanimous that crossover\n\ndistricts should be considered in the § 5 analysis; the dissent\n\nobjected only to the use of those influence districts in which it\n\nwas not clear that minority voters would have an ability to elect\n\neven with crossover support.

We decline to\n\nhold, as a matter of law, that they are not.\n\n            This   conclusion       is    consistent        with    our    decision    in\n\nVecinos de Barrio Uno, supra, where this court held that an\n\n\"influence district\" that was twenty-eight percent Hispanic should\n\nbe    considered   in     the   determination          of   whether       the   minority\n\npopulation's voting strength had been diluted.                     72 F.3d at 990-91\n\n(\"[T]he voting strength of a minority group is not necessarily\n\nlimited to districts in which its members constitute a majority of\n\nthe voting age population, but also extends to every district in\n\nwhich its members are sufficiently numerous to have a significant\n\nimpact at the ballot box most of the time.\").                      Unlike the present\n\ncase, the influence district in Vecinos de Barrio Uno was used by\n\nthe   defendant    city    as   evidence        that    the   minority      population\n\nretained political power. Moreover, the city was not alleging that\n\nthe minority group could elect its own candidate with crossover\n\nsupport, but only that it was large enough to wield influence over\n\nthe outcome.       Despite these factual differences, this court's\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\frecognition that influence districts may be used to show the\n\nexistence of the political power of minority groups reinforces the\n\ndecision to recognize, at least in theory, a suit complaining that\n\na crossover district has been unjustly eliminated.\n\n          Though   Gingles   did    not   apply   the   preconditions   to\n\ninfluence claims, however they are defined, some preconditions must\n\napply in order to link the complained-of voting practice with the\n\nharm the plaintiffs allege.         Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48-51; see\n\nVecinos, 72 F.3d at 979 n.2 (\"[The first] precondition will have to\n\nbe reconfigured to the extent that the courts eventually validate\n\nso-called influence dilution claims.\").       For the purposes of this\n\ndiscussion, we assume that plaintiffs' claim must satisfy the\n\nsecond and third Gingles preconditions, and that some form of the\n\nfirst precondition will also apply.\n\n          2.    Majority Requirement\n\n          The   first   Gingles    precondition    requires   that   \"the\n\nminority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently\n\nlarge and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a\n\nsingle-member district.\"     478 U.S. at 50.

And finally,\n\nit contravenes the plain text of § 2, which requires courts to\n\nconsider the \"totality of the circumstances.\"\n\n\n\n       11\n       On defendants' theory, a discrete, geographically compact\nracial group (here, African-Americans) is not entitled to avail\nitself of § 2 of the VRA until it is large enough to constitute a\nnumerical majority in any given district.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f            Requiring the protected class to show that it is an\n\nabsolute majority ignores the reality that the class could elect\n\nits preferred candidate without such numbers.          Thus, a discussion\n\nof   whether     the   protected   class   forms   a   \"majority\"    is   not\n\nnecessarily helpful in determining whether an \"electoral law,\n\npractice,   or    structure    interacts   with    social   and   historical\n\nconditions,\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47, to impair the ability of the\n\nclass to vote.         The plaintiffs here have alleged that African-\n\nAmerican voters formed a politically cohesive group that was able,\n\nwith the assistance of crossover voting, to elect the candidate of\n\nits preference in a district that was less than fifty percent\n\nAfrican-American and that, in a properly drawn district, they could\n\ncontinue to do so.\n\n            In the context of this case, that pleading suffices to\n\nsatisfy the interests identified by the Supreme Court for the first\n\nGingles precondition. That precondition should not be read without\n\nregard to its function: to determine whether \"the ability of\n\nminority voters to elect representatives of their choice\" is\n\nimpeded.    Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48.       As the Court has noted, \"the\n\nGingles factors cannot be applied mechanically and without regard\n\nto the nature of the claim.\"       Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 158.12     Gingles\n\n\n     12\n        Consonant with its holding that the Gingles preconditions\nare in some form applicable to single-member districts, the Supreme\nCourt has consistently avoided applying the first precondition to\nchallenges to such districts.     See De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1009\n(assuming the first precondition is satisfied); Voinovich, 507 U.S.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fitself, in reviewing a multi-member district, noted that the\n\nfunction of the first precondition was to assure that there was a\n\ncausal relationship between the creation of the district lines and\n\nthe harm to the plaintiffs; if the minority group's candidate could\n\nnot prevail even in a single district, then \"the multimember form\n\ncannot be responsible for minority voters' inability to elect its\n\ncandidates.\"     478 U.S. at 50 (emphasis removed).           Similarly, when\n\ndiscussing    majority   bloc   voting    in    the    context    of   the   third\n\nprecondition, Gingles defined it as that which is sufficient\n\nusually to \"defeat the combined strength of minority support plus\n\nwhite crossover votes.\"         Id. at 56 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Jenkins v.

See\n\ngenerally Quiet Revolution in the South (C. Davidson & B. Grofman\n\neds., 1994).       Indeed, usually a mere majority was not sufficient;\n\nmany believed that to overcome racial bloc voting patterns, the\n\ntotal   minority      population   needed     to    be   sixty-five    percent.\n\nSee Ketchum v.

It would be discordant with\n\nthe Act, for instance, to consider a crossover district claim from\n\na numerically tiny minority population that can only claim a hope\n\nto elect a candidate with an overwhelming number of crossover\n\nvotes.    Several limiting principles readily present themselves.15\n\n\nassumes that there will not be sufficient bloc voting by Hispanic\nvoters after the redistricting to defeat the African-American\ncommunity's candidate of choice.\n     Further, the dissent assumes that \"whites and Hispanics would\nhave to cast almost half of the votes needed for a successful\nsenatorial candidacy.\"     In a plurality race, as the dissent\napparently concedes, that is almost certainly untrue. Even in a\ntwo-candidate race, it may be untrue -- given, for example, low\noverall voter turnout, high African-American turnout, and African-\nAmerican bloc voting. Similarly, the dissent assumes that a 5%\nreduction in the African-American population is insignificant. But\nthe former African-American state senator may have lost the\nelection by that 5%.\n     Each of these assumptions reflects factual inferences that,\nby law, must be made in plaintiffs' favor on a motion to dismiss.\nUnited States v.

We reach no conclusion concerning other types of influence\nclaims, which, if they are recognized, may require a different\napplication of the Gingles preconditions and different limiting\nprinciples.\n\n                                -24-\n\f             First, this case presents a claim not merely of an\n\nabstract hope to elect the African-American voters' preferred\n\ncandidate through both African-American and crossover voting.              The\n\nalleged loss is much more concrete.                Historically, the African-\n\nAmerican community's preferred candidate was consistently elected,\n\neven though African-American voters were less than a numerical\n\nmajority   in    the    district.     The    redistricting    plan,   however,\n\nsignificantly reduced the percentage of African-American voters in\n\nthe district, and the candidate lost his bid for reelection.\n\nAfrican-American voters sued, saying they had been denied an equal\n\nopportunity to elect the candidate of their choice, and on this\n\nmotion to dismiss, the redistricting plan must be taken as the\n\ncause of the lost election.         That is not to say that a history of\n\nelectoral success is a necessary part of a successful claim,\n\nespecially if the lack of success is due to historic vote dilution,\n\nbut the minority group's historical voting success makes this an\n\neasier case.\n\n             The second is the statutory requirement that a minority\n\npopulation      be     able   to    elect,    in     a   potential    district,\n\n\"representatives of their choice.\"            42 U.S.C. 1973(b) (emphasis\n\nsupplied).      A minority group may require so many crossover votes\n\nthat it does not truly have the capacity to choose its own\n\ncandidate, but only to help elect candidates chosen by other\n\ngroups.    If so, plaintiffs cannot make a crossover district claim.\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fHere, however, the plaintiffs clearly plead in their complaint that\n\nthe African-American community can elect its own candidate with\n\ncrossover support in a properly drawn district.\n\n             The      third   limitation     is     expressed      in     the   third\n\nGingles precondition: \"the minority must be able to demonstrate\n\nthat the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it\n\n. . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"                     478\n\nU.S. at 51.        A minority population that is too small, and that\n\ntherefore requires too high a level of crossover support, will not\n\nbe able to meet the third precondition. If the majority population\n\nis    willing    to    provide   crossover        support   to    minority-chosen\n\ncandidates at very high levels, then it cannot be said to be voting\n\nas a bloc against these candidates.                 For the reasons described\n\nbelow,     the   plaintiffs'     complaint    offers    enough      on    the   third\n\nprecondition to render a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on that ground\n\ninappropriate.16\n\n             Finally, we note that this is not a situation, as in\n\nGeorgia v. Ashcroft, supra, where the leaders of the African-\n\nAmerican community developed the redistricting plan at issue.                     The\n\ncontrary is true here.         With only one state senator out of fifty,\n\nthe   African-American        community    had     precious      little    political\n\nstrength in the senate before the redistricting.                   After the plan\n\n\n      16\n       The parties agree that the second Gingles precondition is\nmet by the plaintiffs' pleading that \"African-American voters in\nthe State of Rhode Island are politically cohesive.\"\n\n                                      -26-\n\fwas implemented, they lost their only representation.                   Similarly,\n\nthis is not a case about the failure to maximize potential African-\n\nAmerican voting power.        Cf. Abrams v.

Third Precondition: Majority Bloc Voting\n\n            The   third   Gingles     precondition        requires      that    \"the\n\nminority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes\n\nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it               . . . usually to defeat the\n\nminority's preferred candidate.\"          478 U.S. at 51.         Again, this is\n\npart   of   a   functional     approach      to   the   Act.      See    id.    (\"In\n\nestablishing      this    last      circumstance,        the   minority        group\n\ndemonstrates that submergence in a white multimember district\n\nimpedes its ability to elect its chosen representatives.\").                     This\n\ncourt has described the third condition as addressing \"whether the\n\nchallenged practice, procedure, or structure is the cause of the\n\nminority group's inability to mobilize its potential voting power\n\nand elect its preferred candidates,\" Vecinos, 72 F.3d at 980, and\n\nreferred to the bloc simply as a \"majoritarian\" bloc, id. at 981,\n\n982.\n\n            The district court held that the plaintiffs' complaint\n\nfailed to satisfy this third condition.                 First, it read Gingles\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fspecifically to require that the majority bloc must be a white\n\nnumerical majority. While the complaint does not specify the white\n\npopulation of Senate District 2, it can be no more than 31.84%\n\nafter subtracting the African-American and Hispanic population.\n\nFurthermore, the court calculated that because the old district was\n\nonly twenty-six percent African-American, the crossover vote needed\n\nto elect the candidate preferred by African-American voters would\n\nhave to constitute twenty-four percent of the electorate.   If half\n\nof that crossover vote were white, the court reasoned, then the\n\nwhite population would be crossing over at a rate of about one-\n\nthird, which it thought too high to be consistent with \"bloc\n\nvoting\" needed to \"defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"\n\nMetts, 217 F. Supp. 2d at 260-61.\n\n          This reasoning has several flaws.       Inherent in the\n\ncourt's analysis is the assumption that the electoral contest would\n\nhave only two candidates. That is not necessarily so, particularly\n\nin primaries.     In many jurisdictions, the winner of a particular\n\nparty's primary is de facto the winner of the general election; it\n\nmay be inferred that this was historically the case in the old\n\nSenate District 9 and it remains true in the reconfigured Senate\n\nDistrict 2.     The court also allocated the crossover vote half to\n\nwhites and half to Hispanics, but there is simply no evidence of\n\nthe racial composition of the crossover votes, either historically\n\nor in a proposed alternative district.\n\n\n                                -28-\n\f              Further, we reject the district court's impermissible\n\nfocus on only the white voters in Senate District 2 for purposes of\n\nthe   third     Gingles      precondition.          The    plaintiffs,      in     their\n\ncomplaint, claim that \"[t]he white and Hispanic communities vote\n\nsufficiently as a bloc usually to defeat the candidate of choice of\n\nAfrican-American voters when that candidate is African-American and\n\nthe district      is       less   than   twenty-six       percent   black    in    total\n\npopulation.\"     Under the standards of Rule 12(b)(6), such claims in\n\nthe complaint may be rejected only if they are \"bald assertions\" or\n\n\"unsupportable conclusions.\"             Chongris v.

We agree.\n\n          The district court's rationale does, however, highlight\n\na potential difficulty with the plaintiffs' complaint.                In the\n\nplaintiffs'   proposed    remedial     district,   the    African-American\n\npopulation would be at least twenty-six percent.           Depending on how\n\nthe facts are developed, that number may raise issues related to\n\nthe third precondition.     If it is true that a majority (rather than\n\nonly a plurality) is needed to elect a candidate, if the racial\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fmakeup of the voters is proportional to the racial composition of\n\nthe district, and if, as the plaintiffs assert, the African-\n\nAmerican voters are politically cohesive, then crossover voting\n\nwould need to reach twenty-four percent. In that scenario, thirty-\n\ntwo percent of the non-African-American voters would have to\n\nsupport the African-American community's chosen candidate in order\n\nto reach the majority needed.        The district court believed that\n\nsuch a high rate of crossover voting would be inconsistent with a\n\nfinding of bloc voting.\n\n          At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, that conclusion is premature.\n\nA series of factual assumptions would be required to judge the\n\naverage level of crossover support the plaintiffs are alleging,\n\nassumptions that cannot be confirmed or repudiated at this stage of\n\nthe   proceedings.    While    the    complaint's   description    of   a\n\nreconfigured district includes total population figures, there is\n\nno demographic information concerning the voting age population,\n\nthe number of registered voters, or the expected voters in any\n\ngiven election, much less the typical voting patterns of various\n\ngroups.   There are also no facts about the number of candidates\n\nthat typically run in the primary or general elections.           Without\n\nsuch information, it is impossible to know the percentage of\n\ncrossover support necessary to elect the candidate of the African-\n\nAmerican community's choice.\n\n          More importantly, even if the facts show that crossover\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fvoting of thirty-two percent would be required, that number,\n\nwithout more, does not warrant a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for\n\nfailure     to    state   a    claim     in      light     of    the    third\n\nGingles precondition.     The statute commands an examination of \"the\n\ntotality of circumstances.\"     42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).        An inquiry into\n\nthe third precondition is thus an inherently factual enterprise.\n\n\"[T]he degree of racial bloc voting that is cognizable as an\n\nelement of a § 2 vote dilution claim will vary according to a\n\nvariety of factual circumstances.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57-58; see\n\nVecinos, 72 F.3d at 989.      The Supreme Court has been chary of per\n\nse rules in this area, whether the claim is that a device is a per\n\nse violation of § 2, Voinovich, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, or whether the claim\n\nis that a single factor is a safe harbor for defendants, De Grandy,\n\n512 U.S. at 1017-18.\n\n            One   important   factor     about     which   the   record    is\n\nundeveloped is the pattern of voting behavior over time.               Gingles\n\nstressed the importance of determining whether racial bloc voting\n\nis a pattern extending over time or merely a phenomenon in a single\n\nelection.   478 U.S. at 57.    The reverse is also true: the success\n\nof a minority candidate, or the absence of bloc voting in a few\n\nelections, cannot be taken to mean that the district does not\n\nexperience racial bloc voting overall.

Abrams was decided after trial\non a full record. The record revealed that there was, over time,\nan increased general willingness of white voters to vote for black\ncandidates, and a corresponding decrease in racial polarization.\nThe Abrams Court did not purport to establish a mathematical litmus\ntest for screening cases under the third Gingles precondition on a\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n                                   -33-\n\f            The dissent misses the point when it objects that the VRA\n\nis not meant \"to ensure the success of candidates favored by\n\nminority groups.\"       In this case, it is undisputed that a minority\n\ngroup's preferred candidate, an incumbent, failed to win reelection\n\nin   the   first   election    after   the    state   legislature       adopted   a\n\nredistricting plan that decreased the percentage representation of\n\nthat minority in the candidate's home electoral district. No court\n\nhas ever held -- and it would be clear error for a court to hold --\n\nthat such a defeat is irrelevant to the question whether members of\n\nthat minority group \"have less opportunity than other members of\n\nthe electorate to participate in the political process and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b). Plaintiffs\n\nseek equality of opportunity, not a guarantee of electoral success.\n\n            The    district    court's       dismissal   of    the     plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to meet the third Gingles\n\nprecondition was inappropriate.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n            Congress,     in   enacting       the   Voting    Rights    Act,   was\n\ncognizant of this country's long and shameful history of excluding\n\nAfrican-Americans from our political processes.                In light of the\n\npurposes of the Fourteenth Amendment and its guarantee of equal\n\nprotection of the laws, it is no answer to say, as the dissent\n\ndoes, that the federal courts should close their doors to possibly\n\nmeritorious complaints under the Voting Rights Act out of deference\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\fto majoritarian will and \"difficult\" legislative choices.           That is\n\nparticularly    true   at   this   early   stage   of   the     litigation.\n\nPlaintiffs must still prove their case; they must establish the\n\nGingles preconditions, as well as a substantive violation of the\n\nVRA, with evidence.    There is no frustration of majoritarian will\n\nin requiring the defendants to respond to allegations that state a\n\nclaim under the Act.   The dissent describes such a claim as a quest\n\nfor \"unfair advantage.\"      To the contrary, the complaint states a\n\nclaim of unfair disadvantage to African-American voters in the\n\nexercise of the most important right in our American democracy. If\n\nplaintiffs ultimately prevail, it will be because they have proven\n\nthat the Rhode Island legislature, acting for the majority, has\n\nviolated the Voting Rights Act by impermissibly denying members of\n\nthe African-American community in Providence an equal opportunity\n\nto elect a state senator of their choice.          As the Supreme Court\n\nstated in Georgia v. Ashcroft, \"[t]he purpose of the Voting Rights\n\nAct is to prevent discrimination in the exercise of the electoral\n\nfranchise and to foster our transformation to a society that is no\n\nlonger fixated on race.\"     123 S.Ct. at 2517.\n\n          The plaintiffs must be given the opportunity to prove\n\ntheir case.    We express no view as to the outcome.          The dismissal\n\nof the plaintiffs' complaint is reversed and the case is remanded\n\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fDissenting opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n           -36-\n\f          SELYA,    Circuit     Judge   (dissenting).         Although   it   is\n\nregrettable that redistricting may make it more difficult for a\n\ncandidate preferred by African-American voters to win election to\n\nthe Rhode Island state senate, the Voting Rights Act is not\n\nintended as a means of ensuring that every minority group has\n\nexactly the district lines that it deems most advantageous. In the\n\ncircumstances of this case, I can discern no valid legal basis for\n\nus to superimpose the appellants' will on that of the Rhode Island\n\nGeneral Assembly.        I would therefore affirm the district court's\n\ndismissal of the amended complaint.\n\n          My reasoning is rooted in precedent.               The Supreme Court\n\nhas made it reasonably clear that, as a threshold requirement for\n\nthe maintenance     of    a   vote   dilution   claim   in    a   single-member\n\ndistrict, plaintiffs must show (1) that they are part of a minority\n\ngroup that is sufficiently large and geographically compact to\n\nconstitute a majority in some plausible iteration of the affected\n\ndistrict; (2) that the group is politically cohesive; and (3) that\n\nother racial groups engage in bloc voting significant enough to\n\ndefeat the minority group's preferred candidate.

Given the nature\n\nof their claim, I think it is fairly clear that the appellants\n\ncannot satisfy the first precondition.            It is absolutely clear,\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\fhowever, that they cannot simultaneously satisfy both the first and\n\nthird preconditions.\n\n          I   start   with   the   first   Gingles   precondition.   The\n\nappellants concede that they are unable to show that African-\n\nAmericans can constitute a literal majority in any plausible\n\niteration of Senate District 2.       Rather, their complaint rests on\n\nthe novel premise that a minority group whose members cannot\n\nconceivably comprise a numerical majority, even in what is from\n\ntheir point of view an ideally configured single-member district,\n\nnonetheless can mount a viable vote dilution claim by demonstrating\n\nthat the district's lines could have been drawn in such a way as to\n\ngive the minority group the ability to elect the candidate its\n\nmembers prefer.   Whether or not this type of claim ever can fall\n\nwithin the purview of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA), 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1973, the instant claim does not. The identified minority\n\ngroup is so small and its need to rely on crossover voting so great\n\nthat the appellants' section 2 claim necessarily fails.\n\n          It is common ground that courts must apply the Gingles\n\npreconditions to the ideal district proposed by those who challenge\n\na redistricting plan.

In this case, the appellants concede\n\nthat the adoption of a constitutional amendment downsizing the\n\nGeneral Assembly required redistricting of the state senate. Thus,\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\fSenate     District      9   could    not    remain       intact     and     had    to    be\n\nreconfigured.        With this in mind, the appellants describe their\n\nideal version of Senate District 2 as a district in which African-\n\nAmericans      comprise      roughly     26%       of    the    population.              This\n\nconfiguration differentiates the appellants' case from the mine-\n\nrun. Typically, vote dilution claims address redistricting schemes\n\nthat take a racial minority group whose members have the potential\n\nto comprise a numerical majority in a geographically compact\n\ndistrict and disperse the group across two or more districts (with\n\nthe result that its members constitute a majority in none).                               See\n\nVoinovich, 507 U.S. at 153.\n\n              My colleagues suggest that we can change the paradigm\n\nbecause the appellants may have been deprived of a \"crossover\n\ndistrict\" — a kind of \"influence district\" in which a numerical\n\nminority      is   so    positioned    that    it       has    an   ability    to    swing\n\nelections.

Consequently, the redistricting plan is vulnerable\n\nunder section 2 of the VRA because the electorate's polarization is\n\n\n\n      18\n       This estimate is conservative. To the extent that voter\nregistration or voter turnout differs, or that African-Americans\nare not completely monolithic in their voting preferences, the\nneeded thresholds become harder to achieve.\n\n                                         -41-\n\fso   deeply    entrenched    that   candidate-specific     variations   will\n\noperate only within a 5% margin.\n\n              Whether viewed as a matter of logic, political science,\n\nor   human     behavior,    this    prediction   strikes   me   as   utterly\n\nconjectural.      For good reason, a difference of a few percentage\n\npoints in the minority population of a single-member district\n\ngenerally has been thought unlikely to affect election outcomes.\n\nSee S.

The appellant's claim flies in the\n\nteeth of this conventional wisdom — and the mere fact that one very\n\npopular candidate, running uphill, had a series of successes in the\n\n\"old\" district does not validate the appellants' claim.\n\n              Even if I must indulge the claim because the district\n\ncourt chose to act at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the most that can be\n\nsaid is that the appellants had forged a sort of functional\n\nmajority in former Senate District 9.        By that I mean that African-\n\nAmericans, though neither numerous nor concentrated enough to\n\ncomprise a majority in the district, exhibited an ability to elect\n\na particularly appealing candidate with the aid of a large and\n\npredictable non-African-American crossover vote.           But whatever may\n\nbe said for functional majority claims in general, the appellants'\n\nfunctional majority claim is a non-starter.            Where, as here, a\n\nminority group comprises only a relatively small fraction of the\n\ntotal population of an electoral district before redistricting, the\n\n\n                                     -42-\n\finability of group members to elect the candidate of their choice\n\nafter    redistricting       can   much    more    readily   be   attributed    to\n\ncandidate-specific issues than to a slight reduction in their\n\nnumbers.     In all events, a minority group of that modest size must\n\nrely    so   heavily    on   crossover      votes,    both   before   and    after\n\nredistricting, that section 2 of the VRA provides no safe harbor.\n\n             The figures tell the tale.           In the appellants' idealized\n\ndistrict, whites and Hispanics would have to cast almost half of\n\nthe votes needed for a successful senatorial candidacy.                      Those\n\nvotes would not correlate with the individual voter's race, but,\n\nrather, with the race of the candidate, or, alternatively, with the\n\nrace of the minority group members with whom the crossover voters\n\nidentify.     This fact has two important implications.             In the first\n\nplace, it confirms that, regardless of how the district's lines are\n\ndrawn, African-Americans by themselves do not have anything close\n\nto an ability to elect the candidate of their choice.                       In the\n\nsecond place, it demonstrates that the appellants' claim puts the\n\nemphasis not on assuring equal opportunity for minority voters but\n\non     assuring   a    victory     by     the   African-Americans'    preferred\n\ncandidate.     That is the wrong emphasis.            See 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b)\n\n(identifying \"members of a class of citizens,\" not candidates, as\n\nthe operative unit of statutory protection); see also De Grandy,\n\n512 U.S. at 1014 n.11 (explaining that \"the ultimate right of § 2\n\nis equality of opportunity, not a guarantee of electoral success\");\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\fSmith v.

That increased political clout would come\n\nat the expense of the remaining two-thirds of the white and\n\nHispanic voters.    The VRA empowers courts to protect the rights of\n\na minority group to participate in the electoral process so that\n\nsuch a group, if treated fairly, can become a majority.             It does\n\nnot give courts the raw power to privilege the interests of the few\n\nover the interests of the many, much less the power to override the\n\nnormal functioning of the majoritarian process.          See Vecinos, 72\n\nF.3d at 982; Smith, 984 F.2d at 1400-02.\n\n          The    democratic   system   remains   the   best   and   fairest\n\nelectoral system ever devised.

As I already\n\nhave explained, however, that is not the objective of the VRA.            Nor\n\nshould it be; my colleagues' \"functional approach\" would create a\n\ntopsy-turvy   world   in   which   legislatures       would   have   to   base\n\nredistricting   plans   not   on   the    need   to   preserve   legitimate\n\nmajority/minority districts, but, rather, on guesswork about the\n\nway in which each constituent was likely to vote.19\n\n\n     19\n        My colleagues write that \"[i]n this case, it is undisputed\nthat a minority group's preferred candidate, an incumbent, failed\nto win reelection in the first election after the state legislature\nadopted a redistricting plan that decreased the percentage\nrepresentation of that minority in the candidate's home electoral\ndistrict.\" Maj.

There is a critical distinction between\n\nminority-preferred              candidates       who     lose      because    redistricting\n\nexcludes too much of the minority electorate from a particular\n\ndistrict (illegal vote dilution) and minority-preferred candidates\n\nwho lose because they do not attract enough votes from other folks\n\nwithin    the       district      (legal     majoritarian           rule).      The    amended\n\ncomplaint, even when taken at face value, blurs this distinction.\n\n               My    colleagues         attempt     to      blunt    the     force    of   this\n\nreasoning in two ways. First, they posit that vote dilution claims\n\nmust be decided based on the totality of the circumstances.                                That\n\nis so — but the statutory provision they cite, 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b),\n\ndoes     not    inoculate         all     such     claims       against      Rule     12(b)(6)\n\nchallenges.          A    plaintiff       class     must     do     more   than      cry   \"vote\n\ndilution\"       to    engage       the     gears       of    the    VRA.

On\n\nthe other hand, cases in which courts have recognized a section 2\n\nclaim by members of a small minority group simply because they\n\nreside in a jurisdiction that employs a plurality election system\n\nare nonexistent.    Moreover, plurality election rules are, as my\n\ncolleagues apparently concede, more responsive to minority voters\n\nthan simple majority election rules.    It would be ironic to relax\n\nthe first Gingles precondition for vote dilution claims arising\n\n\n     20\n        Given the widespread popularity of plurality election\nsystems, the Supreme Court must certainly have taken their\nexistence into account in formulating the Gingles preconditions.\nCf. Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 157 (applying the Gingles preconditions\nwithout making any allowance for Ohio's use of a plurality voting\nsystem). I therefore see no reason why we should not adhere to the\nSupreme Court's rendition of the first Gingles precondition without\nengaging in rank speculation about the possibility of multiple\ncandidacies.\n\n                                -47-\n\funder an electoral structure already more favorable to minorities.\n\nIt also would make little sense, politically or mathematically, to\n\nproclaim that a plurality rule supports a minority group's ability\n\nto elect when its members number 26% of the electorate yet utterly\n\nforecloses that ability when they number 21% of the electorate.\n\n              Last — but far from least — my colleagues' reliance on\n\nthe    existence     of    a     plurality     election      system   ignores     the\n\nvicissitudes of such systems.           For example, in elections in which\n\nonly two candidates are on the ballot or in which one of several\n\ncandidates enjoys great popularity, minorities will have to muster\n\na clear majority of all votes cast in order to elect the candidate\n\nof their choice.       The permutations are endless.              To my mind, this\n\nmeans that the putative effects of a plurality voting system are\n\nsimply too speculative to provide a basis for a convincing vote\n\ndilution claim.      See Brewer v. Ham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524301\"><a href=\"/opinion/524301/mrs-cloerine-brewer-tae-chin-gilmore-and-humberto-flores-cross-appellees/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455-56 (5th Cir.\n\n1989); McNeil, 851 F.2d at 944.          These problems may explain why the\n\nappellants     never      made    reference    to    Rhode    Island's   plurality\n\nelection laws in their amended complaint or their appellate briefs.\n\n              That ends this aspect of the matter.             While I am willing\n\nto    leave   open   the    possibility       that   a   racial    minority     group\n\nconstituting less than 50% of the electorate in a particular\n\nsingle-member district may in special circumstances satisfy the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -48-\n\ffirst Gingles precondition,21 the facts alleged in this case reflect\n\nno such special circumstances.         I conclude, therefore, that the\n\nappellants' claim does not and cannot satisfy the first Gingles\n\nprecondition.\n\n          If more were needed — and I doubt that it is — the\n\nappellants'     claim   also   fails   to   satisfy   the   third   Gingles\n\nprecondition.    That precondition requires a showing of nonminority\n\nbloc voting (which, for purposes of this case, encompasses the\n\ncombined voting power of whites and Hispanics).              Here, such a\n\nshowing is inconsistent with the theme around which the appellants'\n\ncase is constructed.\n\n          The appellants showcase Senator Walton's past electoral\n\nsuccesses as proof of the cogency of their ability to elect claim\n\n— but this is a two-edged sword.        Consistent electoral success on\n\nthe part of a racial or ethnic minority group that comprises\n\nconsiderably less than a numerical majority of the electorate is\n\nindicative of the absence of nonminority bloc voting and, thus, is\n\npresumptively inconsistent with the third Gingles precondition.\n\n\n     21\n       Such a situation may occur, for example, where evidence of\nintentional vote dilution exists, e.g., Garza v.

Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 151-52, 158 (approving lower\n\ncourt's finding of no majority bloc voting where \"black candidates\n\nhave been repeatedly elected from [single-member] districts with\n\nonly a 35% black population\").\n\n          To be sure, the appellants asseverate that their past\n\nvictories occurred only because the \"old\" district (in which\n\nAfrican-Americans comprised approximately 26% of the population)\n\nwas different than the \"new\" district (in which African-Americans\n\ncomprise approximately 21% of the population).              But this modest\n\nchange in the level of African-American penetration does not render\n\nthe voters' track record irrelevant. Whatever the precise numbers,\n\nAfrican-Americans were and are a numerical minority in the district\n\n— and the appellants are in effect arguing that whenever crossover\n\nvoting is large enough to secure the success of a minority-\n\npreferred candidate, that crossover voting cannot be used to\n\ndisprove nonminority bloc voting.            Such a rule would conflict with\n\nboth the realities of modern politics and the objectives of section\n\n2.   The better rule is that when African-Americans constitute a\n\nrelatively   small   numerical   minority        yet   repeatedly   attract    a\n\ncrossover vote sizable enough to elect their preferred candidate,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -52-\n\fthat fact is highly relevant to (and, as here, may be conclusive\n\nin) an analysis of the third Gingles precondition.\n\n           In a final effort to salvage the vote dilution claim, my\n\ncolleagues posit that we cannot make any determinations as to the\n\nthird   Gingles    precondition   until   we   have   evidence   of   voter\n\nregistration, turnout, and voting patterns.       That might ordinarily\n\nbe true — but the appellants have not presented us with an ordinary\n\nvote dilution claim.    Rather, they make a very specific and highly\n\nidiosyncratic claim premised on the notion that at least 32% of the\n\nwhite and Hispanic population can be expected regularly to cross\n\nover in order to form the majority required by the first Gingles\n\nprecondition. This approach inextricably intertwines the first and\n\nthird Gingles preconditions, so that allowances given as to one\n\nnecessarily have repercussions as to the other.           See Sanchez v.\n\nColorado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727396\"><a href=\"/opinion/727396/jennie-sanchez-adeline-sanchez-debra-casanova-v-the-state-of-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1315 (10th Cir. 1996) (remarking the\n\ninterrelatedness of these preconditions); Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1133\n\nn.32 (same).      That is one reason why this case cannot survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n           Although \"the degree of racial bloc voting that is\n\ncognizable as an element of a § 2 vote dilution claim will vary\n\naccording to a variety of factual circumstances,\" Gingles, 478 U.S.\n\nat 57-58, the touchstone of the third Gingles precondition is\n\nwhether the majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it to\n\ndefeat the minority's preferred candidate most of the time.             See\n\n\n                                  -53-\n\fid. at 56; Sanchez, 97 F.3d at 1319.           Crossover voting in South\n\nProvidence enabled African-American voters regularly to elect the\n\ncandidate of their choice despite the relatively small African-\n\nAmerican constituency in the predecessor district.             This is a\n\ntelling bit of political history.         See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56\n\n(noting that the amount of nonminority bloc voting that is legally\n\nsignificant varies in part with the size of the minority group\n\nwithin the district); Rangel v. Morales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656123\"><a href=\"/opinion/656123/rita-rangel-v-dan-morales-the-attorney-general-and-the-secretary-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245 (5th Cir.\n\n1993) (same).    It demonstrates to my satisfaction that no legally\n\ncognizable   anti-minority    bloc    voting   exists   here   (and   that,\n\ntherefore, the appellants have failed to meet the third Gingles\n\nprecondition).\n\n            I give the majority its due.        In the ordinary course,\n\ndistrict courts should allow colorable vote dilution claims to\n\nproceed beyond the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.         And, moreover, if one is\n\nwilling to split an infinite number of hairs, it always will be\n\npossible to conjure up remote scenarios that might be disinterred\n\nduring discovery (and, thus, prevent the entry of a motion to\n\ndismiss).    But Rule 12(b)(6) does not invite courts to engage in\n\nsuch endless conjecture.     See Garrett v. Tandy Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n105 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"The method of Rule 12(b)(6) requires courts\n\n. . . to resolve all realistic possibilities in the pleader's\n\nfavor.\" (emphasis supplied)).

Fla. 2002) (three-judge court) (per curiam) (granting\n\ndefendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion with respect to a section 2\n\nclaim).   This is such a case:    the allegations are unapologetic,\n\nthe key facts are essentially undisputed, and the amended complaint\n\nstands or falls on the cogency of the appellants' avant-garde legal\n\ntheory.   Like the district court, I find that theory unacceptable.\n\n             I add a coda.   Reapportionment and redistricting are\n\nthorny matters —    and matters in which state legislatures are best\n\nsuited to lead.      Within wide limits, courts ought to respect\n\nlegislative choices. See Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 156-57 (collecting\n\ncases).   I understand that respect is not equivalent to blind\n\nallegiance, and if there were signs that the Rhode Island General\n\nAssembly had acted in derogation of the Constitution or federal\n\nlaw, I would not hesitate to support judicial intervention.     But\n\nsuch signs are lacking here, so respect counsels restraint.\n\n           Given the mixed racial and ethnic composition of South\n\nProvidence, the Rhode Island General Assembly was caught between a\n\nrock and a hard place.   It made a series of difficult choices, not\n\nperfectly, but within the compass of its legal and constitutional\n\nauthority.     Whether or not I would have drawn the lines of the\n\n\n                                 -55-\n\faffected district in the same manner is beside the point.            What\n\nmatters is that the General Assembly's line-drawing is a product of\n\nlegitimate    legislative   choices   made   within   allowable   limits.\n\nAccepting the appellants' vote dilution claim would nullify these\n\nchoices and give an unfair advantage to a particular subset of\n\nvoters — an advantage beyond any that Congress contemplated in\n\ndrafting the VRA. In the bargain, accepting the claim would shrink\n\nthe   district-wide   Hispanic   population,   thereby   disadvantaging\n\nanother group of minority voters.\n\n             I have said my piece.    Because the appellants fail to\n\nallege the kind of impermissibly race-based distortion of electoral\n\nopportunity that would sustain a claim under section 2 of the VRA,\n\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -56-\n\f</pre>",
