The petitioner, Siono Santosa, an\n\nIndonesian national, seeks judicial review of a final order of the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA upheld the Immigration\n\nJudge's (IJ) denial of his request for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\nSantosa argues that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's\n\ndenial of his claims.     Finding no basis for overturning the order,\n\nwe deny the petition.\n\n                               I.   Background\n\n          Santosa entered the United States in April 2002 as a\n\nnonimmigrant   visitor.        In   September    of   2004,    because   he   had\n\noverstayed his visa, the Department of Homeland Security initiated\n\nremoval proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). Santosa,\n\nin turn, applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\n          In   support    of    his   applications,     Santosa    claimed     he\n\nsuffered persecution in Indonesia because of both his ethnicity and\n\nhis religion -- he is Chinese and a Christian.                 Because of this\n\npersecution, Santosa claimed he held a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.   He described the persecution in testimony and in an\n\naffidavit that the IJ admitted into evidence.                 We summarize the\n\nevidence as follows.\n\n          At a young age, Santosa, who is now in his thirties, was\n\nbullied in Indonesia.          When he was a third grader attending a\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fChristian Baptist elementary school, other students asked him for\n\nmoney   during   recess    and   hit   him   if    he   did   not   provide   it.\n\nSometimes other students would bump Santosa's arm when he was\n\ntrying to eat.     Santosa was also bullied as a teenager.              When he\n\nwas fifteen, a group of around ten people attacked him, hitting him\n\nin the head numerous times.       Santosa testified that he was bullied\n\nbecause he was Chinese and that his Chinese friends were similarly\n\nharassed.\n\n            After graduating from high school, Santosa was the victim\n\nof four robberies.         One robbery took place while Santosa was\n\ntraveling on public transportation.               The perpetrator threatened\n\nSantosa with a knife and took Santosa's wallet and watch.              A second\n\nrobbery occurred while Santosa was traveling on business by car.\n\nIn the early morning hours, he and his driver grew tired and parked\n\non the side of the road to sleep.            Soon thereafter, another car\n\npulled behind them.       The driver of this vehicle, after asking for\n\ndirections, produced a weapon, pulled Santosa from his car, and\n\ndemanded money.    Santosa denied having any money.            When the driver\n\nand an accomplice searched Santosa's car and found otherwise, they\n\nhit Santosa and stole some of his property.             One of the assailants\n\nwore a Muslim headpiece. Santosa's driver, a Muslim, was unharmed.\n\n            A third robbery took place after Santosa was involved in\n\na traffic incident.       Traveling on a motorcycle, Santosa passed a\n\nslow-moving car.    The car then sped up and passed Santosa.            Santosa\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fpassed the car once again.      After Santosa reached a barrier, the\n\ncar pulled in front of him and the driver got out.              The driver\n\nattacked Santosa, eventually calling over two other people who\n\nassisted the driver in beating Santosa.       Though Santosa screamed,\n\nno one came to his aid and the assailants relieved him of his\n\nmoney.   A fourth robbery occurred when a number of non-Chinese\n\nindividuals forced Santosa to give them a ride in his car to a\n\nlocal soccer stadium.      When exiting Santosa's car, the hijackers\n\ntook his watch, mobile phone, and wallet.\n\n           Santosa testified that all of the robberies described\n\nabove were motivated by his Chinese ethnicity.       He also testified\n\nthat people threw rocks at a store that he owned and that his car\n\nwas   destroyed.   These    incidents,   he   claimed,   were    similarly\n\nmotivated by his ethnicity. Eventually, Santosa obtained a visa to\n\nvisit a sister who lived in the United States and left Indonesia.\n\nThe rest of his family, specifically three other siblings and his\n\nmother, remained in Indonesia.\n\n           The IJ rejected Santosa's claim for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under CAT. The IJ first determined that\n\nSantosa had not been the victim of persecution.      He concluded that\n\nthe harassment Santosa suffered as a youth was not directly or\n\nindirectly promoted by the Indonesian government.         He went on to\n\nfind that although Santosa was robbed and beaten up on several\n\noccasions, the robberies and violence were likely motivated by\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fsomething      other    than    Santosa's       ethnicity    or    religion.        In\n\nparticular, the IJ believed that the roadside robbery of Santosa\n\nwas merely a consequence of nefarious opportunism and that \"road\n\nrage\" was to blame for the beating and mugging Santosa suffered\n\nafter    his     traffic       incident.         The    IJ     acknowledged        that\n\ndiscrimination does exist in Indonesia, particularly against ethnic\n\nChinese,    and      that      Santosa    had    been    the      victim    of     that\n\ndiscrimination in some instances.               The IJ noted specifically the\n\noccasion when rocks were thrown at Santosa's store.                         But here\n\nagain,   the    IJ     did   not    connect     the    discrimination       with    the\n\nIndonesian government and ultimately concluded that the petitioner\n\nmerely suffered sporadic, private discrimination.\n\n            As for Santosa's claimed fear of future persecution, the\n\nIJ concluded Santosa was credible, and thus that he likely did fear\n\nfuture persecution.          However, the IJ determined that such a fear\n\nwas not objectively reasonable because nothing in the record\n\njustified it.        Moreover, the IJ observed that some of Santosa's\n\nfamily members remained in Indonesia without event.\n\n            The BIA, writing separately, affirmed the IJ's decision\n\nfor the reasons the IJ set forth.\n\n                                   II.   Discussion\n\n            Santosa pursues two claims in this appeal.                     We address\n\nthem in turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f            A.   Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and CAT\n\n            First, Santosa argues that the BIA's conclusion that he\n\nfailed to establish a viable asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT\n\nclaim is not supported by substantial evidence.           We start with\n\nSantosa's asylum claim because a failure to qualify for asylum\n\nnecessarily   forecloses   a   petitioner's   ability   to   qualify   for\n\nwithholding of removal or protection under CAT.1\n\n            In order to obtain asylum, the petitioner bears the\n\nburden of establishing he is a \"refugee.\"       Afful v. Ashcroft, 380\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2004).       A petitioner may establish refugee\n\nstatus by demonstrating he or she has a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution that is based on one of five statutory grounds.        See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); Zarouite v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d 60, 63 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (noting that the five grounds are race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, and political\n\nopinion).   One way to do so is by showing past persecution, which\n\ntriggers a rebuttable presumption that a fear of future persecution\n\nis well-founded.    Zarouite, 424 F.3d at 63.\n\n            \"Where, as here, 'the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's\n\nruling, but also discussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion,\n\nwe review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions.'\"       Lin v. Gonzales,\n\n\n1\n  The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than\nthat for asylum. Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2002).\nThe CAT standard, in turn, is more stringent than that for\nwithholding of removal. See Tandayu v. Mukasey, 521 F.3d 97, 99\nn.1 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                  -6-\n\f503 F.3d 4, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Zheng v. Gonzales, 475\n\nF.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2007)).           In reviewing the decision, we apply\n\nthe deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard.                    Carcamo-Recinos\n\nv. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 253, 256 (1st Cir. 2004).                           Under this\n\nstandard, we will uphold the decision if it is supported by\n\n\"reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"          Aihua Chiv Wang v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 80,\n\n84 (1st Cir. 2007).            Put differently, we will reverse only if\n\n\"[t]he record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make\n\na contrary determination.\"              8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Pan v.\n\nGonzales, 445 F.3d 60, 61 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              No contrary determination is compelled here.                    First,\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that Santosa\n\nfailed   to    prove    past    persecution.         In     order   to    prove   past\n\npersecution, an alien must provide \"'conclusive evidence' that he\n\nhas   suffered    persecution      on    one   of    five    protected     grounds.\"\n\nRomilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation\n\nomitted).      Although the Immigration and Nationality Act does not\n\nprecisely     define     \"persecution,\"        our   cases     provide     guidance.\n\nNikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005).                    \"[P]ast\n\npersecution      requires       that    the    totality      of     a    petitioner's\n\nexperiences add up to more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness,\n\nharassment,      or    unfair    treatment.\"         Id.     (citation     omitted).\n\nMoreover, \"persecution always implies some connection to government\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\faction or inaction.\" Harutyunyan v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 68 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n           Here, the BIA validly concluded that Santosa failed to\n\nproduce   conclusive   evidence   of    past   persecution.      As    the   IJ\n\nrecognized, aside from the isolated bullying Santosa suffered as a\n\nchild and the occasion when rocks were thrown at his store and his\n\ncar was destroyed, the other incidents were just as or more likely\n\nto have been random acts of violence than persecution based on his\n\nethnicity or religion. See Tobon-Marin v. Mukasey, 512 F.3d 28, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (noting that petitioner must provide sufficient\n\nevidence of a \"causal nexus\" between a protected ground and the\n\npersecution); see also Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30,\n\n37 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[P]ersecution requires more than a showing of\n\neither episodic violence or sporadic abuse.\")          (citation omitted).\n\nMoreover, as the IJ and BIA noted, Santosa failed to demonstrate\n\nthat the government was complicit in any of the incidents he\n\ndescribed.\n\n           Second,     substantial      evidence     supports    the    BIA's\n\nconclusion that Santosa failed to establish a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.     Where, as here, a petitioner has failed to\n\ndemonstrate   past   persecution,      he   must   provide   other    evidence\n\nestablishing his fear is \"well-founded.\"            Velásquez v. Ashcroft,\n\n342 F.3d 55, 58 (1st Cir. 2003), abrogated on other grounds by\n\nBocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 266 (1st Cir. 2005).                  To be\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f\"well-founded\" a fear of future persecution must be both (1)\n\nsubjectively genuine and (2) objectively reasonable.              Toloza-\n\nJiménez v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 155, 161 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Santosa's claim fails on the objective prong.           Santosa\n\nhad to provide \"credible, direct, and specific evidence\" that would\n\nsupport a reasonable fear of individualized        persecution.    Guzman\n\nv. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Ravindran v. INS,\n\n976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992)).        As the IJ noted, the record\n\ncontained no such evidence.      In particular, there was no evidence\n\nthat Santosa's family members who remained in Indonesia suffered\n\nany persecution.\n\n                           B.    Due Process\n\n          Next, Santosa argues that the manner in which the IJ\n\nconducted the immigration hearing violated his right to procedural\n\ndue process under the Fifth Amendment.         In particular, he claims\n\nthe   judge   did   two   things    that     rendered   his   proceeding\n\nconstitutionally    deficient.      First,   after   Santosa's    counsel\n\nquestioned Santosa on direct examination for ten minutes, the IJ\n\ntook over the questioning.      Second, ten minutes after taking over\n\nthe questioning, the IJ ended the direct examination, allowing\n\nSantosa a mere twenty minutes to present his case.2\n\n\n\n2\n  These time periods are based on Santosa's own estimates.\nAlthough the record does not conclusively refute them, the\ntranscript of the hearing contains the IJ's remark that Santosa had\nbeen testifying for an hour and a half.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f            The BIA rejected Santosa's due process claim.          Although\n\nthe board criticized the manner in which the IJ conducted the\n\nhearing, calling it \"troubling,\" the Board concluded that the IJ\n\ngave Santosa an adequate opportunity to present his case.                It\n\nfurther    determined   that   the    IJ's   conduct   did   not   prejudice\n\nSantosa.     We review de novo a claim that an immigration judge's\n\nconduct violated a petitioner's procedural due process rights.\n\nTeng v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing Aguilar\n\nSolis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n            An alien in an immigration proceeding is entitled to \"a\n\nreasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against the alien,\n\nto present evidence on the alien's own behalf, and to cross-examine\n\nwitnesses presented by the Government . . . .\"                8    U.S.C. §\n\n1229a(b)(4)(B).    The proceeding here may have been lacking in some\n\nrespects.    Although it is unclear from the record how much time\n\nSantosa had to testify on direct examination, the IJ may have\n\nprematurely cut off Santosa's presentation of evidence. And though\n\nan IJ may interrogate, examine and cross-examine an alien, id. at\n\n§ 1229a(b)(1), the IJ here may have overstepped his bounds by\n\ncommandeering the questioning when he did.\n\n            Nevertheless, as we recently observed, \"an alien is\n\nentitled to a fair hearing, not necessarily a perfect one.\" Pulsir\n\nv. Mukasey,___F.3d___, No. 07-1356, slip op. at 14 (1st Cir. Apr.\n\n29, 2008).    In the end, an alien must show prejudice in order to\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fsucceed on a due process claim.          Alsamhouri v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d\n\n117, 125 (1st Cir. 2007).       Prejudice is found where \"an abridgment\n\nof due process is likely to have affected the outcome of the\n\nproceedings.\"     Pulsir, slip op. at 15.\n\n            On this record we cannot say that the IJ's handling of\n\nthe case prejudiced Santosa.            First, Santosa testified to some\n\ndegree about nearly all the incidents discussed above.              The only\n\nincident    he   did   not   testify    about,   the   fourth   robbery,   was\n\ndescribed at length in his affidavit.\n\n            Second, even had the IJ allowed Santosa to present his\n\ncase without any limitations, a process to which Santosa is not\n\nentitled,3 we are confident that he could not have advanced a\n\nsuccessful asylum claim.       Santosa's asylum claim was weak.       It was\n\npremised on a series of unrelated events spanning more than twenty\n\nyears.     He failed to identify any government involvement in the\n\nalleged persecution, and failed to establish a nexus between that\n\npersecution and his ethnicity or religion.             Finally, as the BIA\n\nnoted, Santosa failed to identify any information that, but for the\n\n3\n  Although an alien has the right to present evidence on his own\nbehalf,   8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B), an immigration judge has a\nright to regulate the course of the hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.1(c).\n\"When a due process claim is aimed at a trial-management ruling,\n[we] must keep in mind the tension that exists between [these\nrights].\"   Pulsir, slip op at 15.      In any event, because we\nconclude that the IJ's handling of the case did not ultimately\nprejudice Santosa, we need not conclusively determine whether the\nIJ inappropriately curtailed Santosa's presentation of evidence.\nThat said, counsel’s ability to ask questions is important and must\nbe respected.     Had Santosa’s argument for asylum been more\npersuasive, this case may have come out differently.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fIJ's interference, he would have presented to cure the deficiencies\n\nin his application. See Shmyhelskyy v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 474, 482\n\n(7th Cir. 2007) (rejecting alien's due process challenge because\n\nalien failed to explain what additional information he could have\n\npresented     that   would    have    affected    the   IJ's   decision).\n\nConsequently, we find no due process violation.\n\n                             III.    Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons discussed above, the petition is denied.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

Meyer, Attorney, United States Department of Justice, Civil Division, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, MERRITT,<sup>[**]</sup> and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The petitioner, Siono Santosa, an Indonesian national, seeks judicial review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA upheld the Immigration Judge's (IJ) denial of his request for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Santosa argues that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's denial of his claims. Finding no basis for overturning the order, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>Santosa entered the United States in April 2002 as a nonimmigrant visitor. In September of 2004, because he had overstayed his visa, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). Santosa, in turn, applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p>In support of his applications, Santosa claimed he suffered persecution in Indonesia because of both his ethnicity and his religionhe is Chinese and a Christian. Because of this persecution, Santosa claimed he held a well-founded fear of future persecution. He described the persecution in testimony and in an affidavit that the IJ admitted into evidence. We summarize the evidence as follows.</p>\n<p>At a young age, Santosa, who is now in his thirties, was bullied in Indonesia. When he was a third grader attending a Christian Baptist elementary school, other students asked him for money during recess and hit him if he did not provide it. Sometimes other students would bump Santosa's arm when he was trying to eat. Santosa was also bullied as a teenager. When he was fifteen, a group of around ten people attacked him, hitting him in the head numerous times. Santosa testified that he was bullied because he was Chinese and that his Chinese friends were similarly harassed.</p>\n<p>After graduating from high school, Santosa was the victim of four robberies. One robbery took place while Santosa was traveling on public transportation. The perpetrator threatened Santosa with a knife and took Santosa's wallet and watch. A second <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> robbery occurred while Santosa was traveling on business by car. In the early morning hours, he and his driver grew tired and parked on the side of the road to sleep. Soon thereafter, another car pulled behind them. The driver of this vehicle, after asking for directions, produced a weapon, pulled Santosa from his car, and demanded money. Santosa denied having any money. When the driver and an accomplice searched Santosa's car and found otherwise, they hit Santosa and stole some of his property. One of the assailants wore a Muslim headpiece. Santosa's driver, a Muslim, was unharmed.</p>\n<p>A third robbery took place after Santosa was involved in a traffic incident. Traveling on a motorcycle, Santosa passed a slow-moving car. The car then sped up and passed Santosa. Santosa passed the car once again. After Santosa reached a barrier, the car pulled in front of him and the driver got out. The driver attacked Santosa, eventually calling over two other people who assisted the driver in beating Santosa. Though Santosa screamed, no one came to his aid and the assailants relieved him of his money. A fourth robbery occurred when a number of non-Chinese individuals forced Santosa to give them a ride in his car to a local soccer stadium. When exiting Santosa's car, the hijackers took his watch, mobile phone, and wallet.</p>\n<p>Santosa testified that all of the robberies described above were motivated by his Chinese ethnicity. He also testified that people threw rocks at a store that he owned and that his car was destroyed. These incidents, he claimed, were similarly motivated by his ethnicity. Eventually, Santosa obtained a visa to visit a sister who lived in the United States and left Indonesia. The rest of his family, specifically three other siblings and his mother, remained in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>The IJ rejected Santosa's claim for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT. The IJ first determined that Santosa had not been the victim of persecution. He concluded that the harassment Santosa suffered as a youth was not directly or indirectly promoted by the Indonesian government. He went on to find that although Santosa was robbed and beaten up on several occasions, the robberies and violence were likely motivated by something other than Santosa's ethnicity or religion. In particular, the IJ believed that the roadside robbery of Santosa was merely a consequence of nefarious opportunism and that \"road rage\" was to blame for the beating and mugging Santosa suffered after his traffic incident. The IJ acknowledged that discrimination does exist in Indonesia, particularly against ethnic Chinese, and that Santosa had been the victim of that discrimination in some instances. The IJ noted specifically the occasion when rocks were thrown at Santosa's store. But here again, the IJ did not connect the discrimination with the Indonesian government and ultimately concluded that the petitioner merely suffered sporadic, private discrimination.</p>\n<p>As for Santosa's claimed fear of future persecution, the IJ concluded Santosa was credible, and thus that he likely did fear future persecution. However, the IJ determined that such a fear was not objectively reasonable because nothing in the record justified it. Moreover, the IJ observed that some of Santosa's family members remained in Indonesia without event.</p>\n<p>The BIA, writing separately, affirmed the IJ's decision for the reasons the IJ set forth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>Santosa pursues two claims in this appeal. We address them in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> A. Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and CAT</h2>\n<p>First, Santosa argues that the BIA's conclusion that he failed to establish a viable asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT claim is not supported by substantial evidence. We start with Santosa's asylum claim because a failure to qualify for asylum necessarily forecloses a petitioner's ability to qualify for withholding of removal or protection under CAT.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In order to obtain asylum, the petitioner bears the burden of establishing he is a \"refugee.\" <i>Afful v. Ashcroft,</i> 380 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2004). A petitioner may establish refugee status by demonstrating he or she has a well-founded fear of future persecution that is based on one of five statutory grounds. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); <i>Zarouite v. Gonzales,</i> 424 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that the five grounds are race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion). One way to do so is by showing past persecution, which triggers a rebuttable presumption that a fear of future persecution is wellfounded. <i>Zarouite,</i> 424 F.3d at 63.</p>\n<p>\"Where, as here, `the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling, but also discussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions.'\" <i>Lin v. Gonzales,</i> 503 F.3d 4, 6-7 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> 475 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.2007)). In reviewing the decision, we apply the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Carcamo-Recinos v. Ashcroft,</i> 389 F.3d 253, 256 (1st Cir.2004). Under this standard, we will uphold the decision if it is supported by \"reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Aihua Chiv Wang v. Mukasey,</i> 508 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir.2007). Put differently, we will reverse only if \"[t]he record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> 445 F.3d 60, 61 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>No contrary determination is compelled here. First, substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that Santosa failed to prove past persecution. In order to prove past persecution, an alien must provide \"`conclusive evidence' that he has suffered persecution on one of five protected grounds.\" <i>Romilus v. Ashcroft,</i> 385 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004) (citation omitted). Although the Immigration and Nationality Act does not precisely define \"persecution,\" our cases provide guidance. <i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir.2005). \"[P]ast persecution requires that the totality of a petitioner's experiences add up to more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). Moreover, \"persecution always implies some connection to government action or inaction.\" <i>Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,</i> 421 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Here, the BIA validly concluded that Santosa failed to produce conclusive evidence of past persecution. As the IJ recognized, aside from the isolated bullying Santosa suffered as a child and the occasion when rocks were thrown at his store and his car was destroyed, the other incidents were just as or more likely to have been random acts of violence than persecution based on his ethnicity or religion. <i>See </i><i>Tobon-Marin v. Mukasey,</i> 512 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir.2008) (noting that petitioner must provide sufficient evidence of a \"causal nexus\" between a protected ground and the persecution); <i>see also </i><i>Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,</i> 428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[P]ersecution requires more than a showing of either episodic violence or sporadic abuse.\") (citation omitted). Moreover, as the IJ and BIA noted, Santosa failed to demonstrate that the government was complicit in any of the incidents he described.</p>\n<p>Second, substantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that Santosa failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. Where, as here, a petitioner has failed to demonstrate past persecution, he must provide other evidence establishing his fear is \"well-founded.\" <i>Velásquez v. Ashcroft,</i> 342 F.3d 55, 58 (1st Cir.2003), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 266 (1st Cir.2005). To be \"well-founded\" a fear of future persecution must be both (1) subjectively genuine and (2) objectively reasonable. <i>Toloza-Jiménez v. Gonzales,</i> 457 F.3d 155, 161 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Santosa's claim fails on the objective prong. Santosa had to provide \"credible, direct, and specific evidence\" that would support a reasonable fear of individualized persecution. <i>Guzman v. INS,</i> 327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Ravindran v. INS,</i> 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992)). As the IJ noted, the record contained no such evidence. In particular, there was no evidence that Santosa's family members who remained in Indonesia suffered any persecution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Due Process</h2>\n<p>Next, Santosa argues that the manner in which the IJ conducted the immigration hearing violated his right to procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment. In particular, he claims the judge did two things that rendered his proceeding constitutionally deficient. First, after Santosa's counsel questioned Santosa on direct examination for ten minutes, the IJ took over the questioning. Second, ten minutes after taking over the questioning, the IJ ended the direct examination, allowing Santosa a mere twenty minutes to present his case.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The BIA rejected Santosa's due process claim. Although the board criticized the manner in which the IJ conducted the hearing, calling it \"troubling,\" the Board concluded that the IJ gave Santosa an adequate opportunity to present his case. It further determined that the IJ's conduct did not prejudice Santosa. We review de novo a claim that an immigration judge's conduct violated a petitioner's procedural due process rights. <i>Teng v. Mukasey,</i> 516 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p>An alien in an immigration proceeding is entitled to \"a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against the alien, to present evidence on the alien's own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government....\" 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B). The proceeding here may have been lacking in some respects. Although it is unclear from the record how much time Santosa had to testify on direct examination, the IJ may have prematurely cut off Santosa's presentation of evidence. And though an IJ may interrogate, examine and cross-examine an alien, <i>id.</i> at § 1229a(b)(1), the IJ here may have overstepped <span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> his bounds by commandeering the questioning when he did.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, as we recently observed, \"an alien is entitled to a fair hearing, not necessarily a perfect one.\" <i>Pulisir v. Mukasey,</i> 524 F.3d 302, 311 (1st Cir.2008). In the end, an alien must show prejudice in order to succeed on a due process claim. <i>Alsamhouri v. Gonzales,</i> 484 F.3d 117, 125 (1st Cir.2007). Prejudice is found where \"an abridgment of due process is likely to have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\" <i>Pulisir,</i> 524 F.3d at 311.</p>\n<p>On this record we cannot say that the IJ's handling of the case prejudiced Santosa. First, Santosa testified to some degree about nearly all the incidents discussed above. The only incident he did not testify about, the fourth robbery, was described at length in his affidavit.</p>\n<p>Second, even had the IJ allowed Santosa to present his case without any limitations, a process to which Santosa is not entitled,<sup>[3]</sup> we are confident that he could not have advanced a successful asylum claim. Santosa's asylum claim was weak. It was premised on a series of unrelated events spanning more than twenty years. He failed to identify any government involvement in the alleged persecution, and failed to establish a nexus between that persecution and his ethnicity or religion. Finally, as the BIA noted, Santosa failed to identify any information that, but for the IJ's interference, he would have presented to cure the deficiencies in his application. <i>See </i><i>Shmyhelskyy v. Gonzales,</i> 477 F.3d 474, 482 (7th Cir. 2007) (rejecting alien's due process challenge because alien failed to explain what additional information he could have presented that would have affected the IJ's decision). Consequently, we find no due process violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons discussed above, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(C)(2), Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey is substituted for former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as respondent.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for asylum. <i>Mediouni v. INS,</i> 314 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2002). The CAT standard, in turn, is more stringent than that for withholding of removal. <i>See </i><i>Tandayu v. Mukasey,</i> 521 F.3d 97, 99 n. 1 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[2]  These time periods are based on Santosa's own estimates. Although the record does not conclusively refute them, the transcript of the hearing contains the IJ's remark that Santosa had been testifying for an hour and a half.</p>\n<p>[3]  Although an alien has the right to present evidence on his own behalf, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B), an immigration judge has a right to regulate the course of the hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.1(c). \"When a due process claim is aimed at a trial-management ruling, [we] must keep in mind the tension that exists between [these rights].\" <i>Pulisir,</i> 524 F.3d at 311. In any event, because we conclude that the IJ's handling of the case did not ultimately prejudice Santosa, we need not conclusively determine whether the IJ inappropriately curtailed Santosa's presentation of evidence. That said, counsel's ability to ask questions is important and must be respected. Had Santosa's argument for asylum been more persuasive, this case may have come out differently.</p>\n\n</div>",

The BIA upheld the Immigration Judge's (IJ) denial of his request for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Santosa argues that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's denial of his claims. Finding no basis for overturning the order, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>Santosa entered the United States in April 2002 as a nonimmigrant visitor. In September of 2004, because he had overstayed his visa, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). Santosa, in turn, applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p>In support of his applications, Santosa claimed he suffered persecution in Indonesia because of both his ethnicity and his religionhe is Chinese and a Christian. Because of this persecution, Santosa claimed he held a well-founded fear of future persecution. He described the persecution in testimony and in an affidavit that the IJ admitted into evidence. We summarize the evidence as follows.</p>\n<p>At a young age, Santosa, who is now in his thirties, was bullied in Indonesia.

The driver of this vehicle, after asking for directions, produced a weapon, pulled Santosa from his car, and demanded money. Santosa denied having any money. When the driver and an accomplice searched Santosa's car and found otherwise, they hit Santosa and stole some of his property. One of the assailants wore a Muslim headpiece. Santosa's driver, a Muslim, was unharmed.</p>\n<p>A third robbery took place after Santosa was involved in a traffic incident. Traveling on a motorcycle, Santosa passed a slow-moving car. The car then sped up and passed Santosa. Santosa passed the car once again. After Santosa reached a barrier, the car pulled in front of him and the driver got out. The driver attacked Santosa, eventually calling over two other people who assisted the driver in beating Santosa. Though Santosa screamed, no one came to his aid and the assailants relieved him of his money. A fourth robbery occurred when a number of non-Chinese individuals forced Santosa to give them a ride in his car to a local soccer stadium. When exiting Santosa's car, the hijackers took his watch, mobile phone, and wallet.</p>\n<p>Santosa testified that all of the robberies described above were motivated by his Chinese ethnicity. He also testified that people threw rocks at a store that he owned and that his car was destroyed. These incidents, he claimed, were similarly motivated by his ethnicity. Eventually, Santosa obtained a visa to visit a sister who lived in the United States and left Indonesia. The rest of his family, specifically three other siblings and his mother, remained in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>The IJ rejected Santosa's claim for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT. The IJ first determined that Santosa had not been the victim of persecution. He concluded that the harassment Santosa suffered as a youth was not directly or indirectly promoted by the Indonesian government. He went on to find that although Santosa was robbed and beaten up on several occasions, the robberies and violence were likely motivated by something other than Santosa's ethnicity or religion. In particular, the IJ believed that the roadside robbery of Santosa was merely a consequence of nefarious opportunism and that \"road rage\" was to blame for the beating and mugging Santosa suffered after his traffic incident. The IJ acknowledged that discrimination does exist in Indonesia, particularly against ethnic Chinese, and that Santosa had been the victim of that discrimination in some instances.

Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and CAT</h2>\n<p>First, Santosa argues that the BIA's conclusion that he failed to establish a viable asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT claim is not supported by substantial evidence. We start with Santosa's asylum claim because a failure to qualify for asylum necessarily forecloses a petitioner's ability to qualify for withholding of removal or protection under CAT.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In order to obtain asylum, the petitioner bears the burden of establishing he is a \"refugee.\" <i>Afful v.

Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201897\"><a href=\"/opinion/201897/palma-mazariegos-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[P]ersecution requires more than a showing of either episodic violence or sporadic abuse.\") (citation omitted). Moreover, as the IJ and BIA noted, Santosa failed to demonstrate that the government was complicit in any of the incidents he described.</p>\n<p>Second, substantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that Santosa failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. Where, as here, a petitioner has failed to demonstrate past persecution, he must provide other evidence establishing his fear is \"well-founded.\" <i>Velásquez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783402\"><a href=\"/opinion/783402/ricardo-f-velasquez-susana-d-granados-urizar-eluvia-r-granados-urizar/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.2003), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 266 (1st Cir.2005). To be \"well-founded\" a fear of future persecution must be both (1) subjectively genuine and (2) objectively reasonable. <i>Toloza-Jiménez v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></span>, 161 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Santosa's claim fails on the objective prong. Santosa had to provide \"credible, direct, and specific evidence\" that would support a reasonable fear of individualized persecution. <i>Guzman v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200443\"><a href=\"/opinion/200443/guzman-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Ravindran v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 758 (1st Cir. 1992)). As the IJ noted, the record contained no such evidence. In particular, there was no evidence that Santosa's family members who remained in Indonesia suffered any persecution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Due Process</h2>\n<p>Next, Santosa argues that the manner in which the IJ conducted the immigration hearing violated his right to procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment. In particular, he claims the judge did two things that rendered his proceeding constitutionally deficient. First, after Santosa's counsel questioned Santosa on direct examination for ten minutes, the IJ took over the questioning. Second, ten minutes after taking over the questioning, the IJ ended the direct examination, allowing Santosa a mere twenty minutes to present his case.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The BIA rejected Santosa's due process claim. Although the board criticized the manner in which the IJ conducted the hearing, calling it \"troubling,\" the Board concluded that the IJ gave Santosa an adequate opportunity to present his case. It further determined that the IJ's conduct did not prejudice Santosa. We review de novo a claim that an immigration judge's conduct violated a petitioner's procedural due process rights. <i>Teng v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203153\"><a href=\"/opinion/203153/teng-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 568 (1st Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p>An alien in an immigration proceeding is entitled to \"a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against the alien, to present evidence on the alien's own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government....\" 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B). The proceeding here may have been lacking in some respects. Although it is unclear from the record how much time Santosa had to testify on direct examination, the IJ may have prematurely cut off Santosa's presentation of evidence. And though an IJ may interrogate, examine and cross-examine an alien, <i>id.</i> at § 1229a(b)(1), the IJ here may have overstepped <span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> his bounds by commandeering the questioning when he did.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, as we recently observed, \"an alien is entitled to a fair hearing, not necessarily a perfect one.\" <i>Pulisir v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203272\"><a href=\"/opinion/203272/pulisir-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 311 (1st Cir.2008). In the end, an alien must show prejudice in order to succeed on a due process claim. <i>Alsamhouri v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202405\"><a href=\"/opinion/202405/alsamhouri-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 125 (1st Cir.2007). Prejudice is found where \"an abridgment of due process is likely to have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\" <i>Pulisir,</i> 524 F.3d at 311.</p>\n<p>On this record we cannot say that the IJ's handling of the case prejudiced Santosa. First, Santosa testified to some degree about nearly all the incidents discussed above. The only incident he did not testify about, the fourth robbery, was described at length in his affidavit.</p>\n<p>Second, even had the IJ allowed Santosa to present his case without any limitations, a process to which Santosa is not entitled,<sup>[3]</sup> we are confident that he could not have advanced a successful asylum claim. Santosa's asylum claim was weak. It was premised on a series of unrelated events spanning more than twenty years. He failed to identify any government involvement in the alleged persecution, and failed to establish a nexus between that persecution and his ethnicity or religion. Finally, as the BIA noted, Santosa failed to identify any information that, but for the IJ's interference, he would have presented to cure the deficiencies in his application. <i>See </i><i>Shmyhelskyy v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796865\"><a href=\"/opinion/796865/stefan-shmyhelskyy-v-alberto-r-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span>, 482 (7th Cir. 2007) (rejecting alien's due process challenge because alien failed to explain what additional information he could have presented that would have affected the IJ's decision). Consequently, we find no due process violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons discussed above, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(C)(2), Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey is substituted for former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as respondent.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for asylum. <i>Mediouni v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200253\"><a href=\"/opinion/200253/mediouni-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2002). The CAT standard, in turn, is more stringent than that for withholding of removal. <i>See </i><i>Tandayu v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203213\"><a href=\"/opinion/203213/tandayu-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 99 n. 1 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[2]  These time periods are based on Santosa's own estimates. Although the record does not conclusively refute them, the transcript of the hearing contains the IJ's remark that Santosa had been testifying for an hour and a half.</p>\n<p>[3]  Although an alien has the right to present evidence on his own behalf, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B), an immigration judge has a right to regulate the course of the hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.1(c). \"When a due process claim is aimed at a trial-management ruling, [we] must keep in mind the tension that exists between [these rights].\" <i>Pulisir,</i> 524 F.3d at 311. In any event, because we conclude that the IJ's handling of the case did not ultimately prejudice Santosa, we need not conclusively determine whether the IJ inappropriately curtailed Santosa's presentation of evidence. That said, counsel's ability to ask questions is important and must be respected. Had Santosa's argument for asylum been more persuasive, this case may have come out differently.</p>\n\n</div>",
