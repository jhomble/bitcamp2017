This appeal is an early round in\n\nthe legal battle over whether a commercial wind energy farm may be\n\nbuilt in Nantucket Sound.\n\n          In October 2002, Ten Taxpayer Citizens Group and several\n\nadditional plaintiffs (together, Ten Taxpayer) filed a lawsuit in\n\nMassachusetts state court to prevent Cape Wind Associates from\n\nerecting a 197-foot data collection tower in Nantucket Sound.     The\n\ncomplaint alleged that Massachusetts state courts had jurisdiction\n\nover the project and that Cape Wind had failed to obtain the\n\nnecessary permits under state law. Cape Wind removed the action to\n\nfederal court and Ten Taxpayer moved to remand.      After denying the\n\nmotion to remand, the district court dismissed the complaint on\n\nAugust 19, 2003.\n\n          On appeal, Ten Taxpayer argues that the district court\n\nwas obligated to remand the case to state court for lack of federal\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.      Ten Taxpayer also challenges the\n\ncourt's dismissal of the complaint.     We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          The    facts   underlying    this   case   are   essentially\n\nundisputed.     Where the parties disagree, we accept as true the\n\nwell-pleaded factual allegations in the plaintiffs' complaint,\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in their favor.      Soto-Negron v.\n\nTaber Partners I, 339 F.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f           Cape Wind is a limited liability corporation based in\n\nSouth   Yarmouth,   Massachusetts.     Its   goal   is   to   construct   a\n\ncommercial windmill farm on Horseshoe Shoals, a shallow area of\n\nNantucket Sound more than three miles offshore.               The proposed\n\nwindmill farm includes at least 130 industrial wind turbines, each\n\n470 feet tall.      If it is completed as presently envisioned, the\n\nfacility will spread across 28 square miles of Nantucket Sound and\n\nwill be visible from shore.    The project is the first of its kind\n\nin North America.\n\n           To construct the wind farm, Cape Wind needs extensive\n\nmeteorological and oceanographic data concerning conditions on\n\nHorseshoe Shoals.       For that purpose, Cape Wind in late 2001\n\nannounced plans to build a \"scientific measurement device station\"\n\n(SMDS) on Horseshoe Shoals.    Intended as a temporary facility, the\n\nSMDS was designed to collect data for five years.        It would consist\n\nof a data tower rising approximately 200 feet in the air, supported\n\nby three steel pilings driven 100 feet into the seabed.           Together\n\nwith its tripodal support structure, the tower would occupy about\n\n900 square feet of ocean surface.\n\n           On August 19, 2002, the United States Army Corps of\n\nEngineers issued a permit to Cape Wind under § 10 of the Rivers and\n\nHarbors Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. § 401 et seq., for construction of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe SMDS.1    Cape Wind neither sought nor obtained permits for the\n\nSMDS project under Massachusetts law. A few weeks later, the Coast\n\nGuard issued a public notice that construction of the data tower\n\nwould commence on or about October 11, 2002.               Construction was\n\nbriefly delayed when Ten Taxpayer obtained a temporary restraining\n\norder from a state court in a related lawsuit.                 Ten Taxpayer\n\nvoluntarily    dismissed   that     suit,   however,    and   the   temporary\n\nrestraining order lapsed by its own terms.             On October 27, 2002,\n\nCape Wind began construction of the SMDS.         It is now complete and\n\nin operation.2\n\n             Ten Taxpayer filed this action in Barnstable Superior\n\nCourt on October 16, 2002, shortly before construction of the data\n\ntower began.     In its complaint, Ten Taxpayer acknowledged that the\n\nSMDS site is more than three miles from the nearest Massachusetts\n\nshoreline and that, accordingly, the location falls under the\n\njurisdiction of the federal government. Nevertheless, Ten Taxpayer\n\ncontended, Cape Wind could not build the SMDS without regulatory\n\napproval     from   Massachusetts    because    Congress      has   ceded   to\n\nMassachusetts the power to regulate any activity affecting fishing\n\nin Nantucket Sound.        Under the Massachusetts laws regulating\n\n\n     1\n       We express no view concerning the validity of this permit,\nwhich is the subject of a separate appeal in this court.      See\nAlliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of the\nArmy, No. 03-2604 (1st Cir. docketed Nov. 24, 2003).\n     2\n       See generally http://capewind.whgrp.com (last visited June\n22, 2004) (reporting real-time data from the SMDS).\n\n                                     -4-\n\ffisheries and fish habitats, administrative approval is required\n\nfor structures erected on the seabed.        Because Cape Wind did not\n\nobtain such approval, Ten Taxpayer alleged, the SMDS project was in\n\nviolation of Massachusetts law.      Ten Taxpayer sought an injunction\n\nblocking construction of the SMDS or, if the court would not enjoin\n\nconstruction, a $25,000 fine for every day that the SMDS remained\n\non Horseshoe Shoals.\n\n            Cape Wind immediately removed the case to federal court,\n\nasserting    that   federal   jurisdiction    was   proper   because   Ten\n\nTaxpayer's complaint, on its face, states a federal question --\n\ni.e., whether Congress has in fact delegated to Massachusetts the\n\nnecessary regulatory authority over Nantucket Sound.              In the\n\nalternative, Cape Wind argued that regardless of what Ten Taxpayer\n\nactually pleaded in its complaint, deciding Ten Taxpayer's state\n\nclaims would require resolution of a substantial question of\n\nfederal law, cf. Almond v. Capital Props., Inc., 212 F.3d 20, 23\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (describing so-called Smith jurisdiction), and that\n\nfederal law completely preempts state law beyond three miles from\n\nthe coast, cf. Beneficial Nat'l Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 6-7\n\n(2003)   (describing   the    \"complete   preemption\"   doctrine).     Ten\n\nTaxpayer moved to remand.\n\n            On November 14, 2002, the district court denied the\n\nmotion to remand without opinion.          Ten Taxpayer appealed that\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\forder, but this court dismissed the appeal on the ground that it\n\nwas not a final judgment.\n\n           Meanwhile, on November 6, 2002, Cape Wind filed a motion\n\nin federal court to dismiss Ten Taxpayer's complaint.           Cape Wind\n\nattached   to   its   motion   two    letters   from   the   Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Environmental Management indicating that, at least\n\nunder Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 132A, Massachusetts does not claim\n\nregulatory authority over activities on Horseshoe Shoals.             Cape\n\nWind also argued that Ten Taxpayer lacks standing to assert the\n\nCommonwealth's regulatory interest in offshore lands.\n\n            On August 19, 2003, the district court granted Cape\n\nWind's motion to dismiss. Ten Taxpayers Citizen Group v. Cape Wind\n\nAssocs., LLC, 278 F. Supp. 2d 98, 101 (D. Mass. 2003).          The court\n\nconcluded that although Congress did delegate to Massachusetts the\n\npower to regulate fishing in Nantucket Sound, that grant did not\n\nconfer on the Commonwealth a general warrant to \"polic[e] the\n\nentire Nantucket Sound for environmental disturbances that could\n\nimpact fishing.\"      Id.   Massachusetts had no authority over the\n\nconstruction of the SMDS, and thus no state permits were required.\n\nId.\n\n           Ten Taxpayer filed this timely appeal.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           This case implicates the complex and rather obscure body\n\nof law that divides regulatory authority over Nantucket Sound\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fbetween the state and federal governments.              Because that body of\n\nlaw is essential to our disposition of this appeal, we summarize it\n\nbriefly.\n\nA.   Regulation of the Seabed and Attached Structures\n\n            As a general rule, \"paramount rights to the offshore\n\nseabed inhere in the Federal Government as an incident of national\n\nsovereignty.\"     United States v. Maine (Maine I), 420 U.S. 515, 524\n\n(1975).    In a series of cases beginning in 1947, the Supreme Court\n\nestablished that the United States enjoys exclusive title in the\n\nlands underlying the sea, regardless of a state's historical claims\n\nto the waters off its coast.         See United States v. Texas, 339 U.S.\n\n707, 719-20 (1950); United States v. Louisiana, 339 U.S. 699, 705-\n\n06 (1950); United States v. California, 332 U.S. 19, 29-39 (1947).\n\nTogether,     those    cases    established      that    the        \"control   and\n\ndisposition\"     of   the   seabed   is   \"the   business      of    the   Federal\n\nGovernment rather than the States.\"           Maine I, 420 U.S. at 522.\n\n            That background rule, however, has been modified by\n\nCongress    in   several    significant     respects.     Most       importantly,\n\nCongress in 1953 passed the Submerged Lands Act (SLA), 43 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1301 et seq., which grants to the states full title to the seabed\n\nwithin three geographical miles of their shores.3              See 43 U.S.C. §§\n\n1301, 1311.      Moreover, Congress expressly recognized that three-\n\n\n\n      3\n      The three-mile boundary is subject to certain exceptions not\nrelevant here. E.g., 43 U.S.C. § 1301(b).\n\n                                      -7-\n\fmile line as the official seaward boundary of the coastal states.\n\nId. § 1312.\n\n            Shortly thereafter, however, Congress enacted the Outer\n\nContinental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (OCSLA), 43 U.S.C. § 1331 et\n\nseq.   A major purpose of the OCSLA was to specify that federal law\n\ngoverns    on   the   \"outer   Continental   Shelf\"   --    defined    as   all\n\nsubmerged lands under U.S. sovereign control lying seaward of the\n\nthree-mile boundary, see 43 U.S.C. § 1331(a) -- and on any fixed\n\nstructures attached to the outer Continental Shelf.                Rodrigue v.\n\nAetna Casualty & Surety Co., 395 U.S. 352, 355 (1969); see also 43\n\nU.S.C. § 1332 (declaring it to be \"the policy of the United States\n\nthat . . . the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf\n\nappertain to the United States and are subject to its jurisdiction,\n\ncontrol,    and   power   of   disposition\").     The      OCSLA    makes   the\n\nConstitution, laws, and civil and political jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States fully applicable to the outer Continental Shelf.               43\n\nU.S.C. § 1333(a)(1).      It also establishes nationwide rules for the\n\nleasing and development of natural resources in the seabed outside\n\nof state territory.       Id. § 1337.     Further, the OCSLA provides a\n\nfederal cause of action for any person aggrieved by a violation of\n\nthose rules, id. § 1349(a)(1), and grants the federal district\n\ncourts jurisdiction to hear such cases, id. § 1349(b).               It is, in\n\nshort, a sweeping assertion of federal supremacy over the submerged\n\nlands outside of the three-mile SLA boundary.               See id. § 1332\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f(declaring it to be \"the policy of the United States that . . . the\n\nouter Continental Shelf is a vital national resource reserve held\n\nby the Federal Government for the public\" (emphasis added)).\n\n           In    1975,    the   Supreme     Court     confirmed    this   broad\n\nunderstanding of the OCSLA in Maine I.                The United States had\n\nbrought an original complaint in the Supreme Court against thirteen\n\nstates bordering the Atlantic Ocean, alleging that each state had\n\nclaimed some right or title in the outer Continental Shelf that was\n\ninconsistent with federal interests.               420 U.S. at 516-17.       In\n\nreply, the defendant states (including Massachusetts) had denied\n\nthe United States's title in the outer Continental Shelf, asserted\n\na variety of historical claims to the seabed beyond the SLA's\n\nthree-mile boundary, and urged the Court to overrule its decisions\n\nin California, Louisiana and Texas.              Id. at 517-19.    The Supreme\n\nCourt ruled for the United States, reaffirming that \"paramount\n\nrights\" in the seabed belong to the federal government as national\n\nsovereign.      Id. at 524.     The SLA, the Court acknowledged, had\n\ntransferred title to the states in a narrow band of the seabed.\n\nBut that statute did not alter the federal government's rights\n\noutside of that narrow band.         Id. at 526.          On the contrary, the\n\nCourt   explained,       Congress   in     the    OCSLA     had   \"emphatically\n\nimplemented its view that the United States has paramount rights to\n\nthe seabed beyond the three-mile limit.\"             Id.\n\nB.   Regulation of Fishing and Marine Fisheries\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            With   the    framework    for    regulating    the     seabed   thus\n\nsettled, Congress in 1976 enacted the Magnuson (now Magnuson-\n\nStevens) Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1801\n\net seq.\n\n            Like the OCSLA, the Magnuson-Stevens Act asserts federal\n\ncontrol over the waters outside of the three-mile limit of state\n\njurisdiction. The Act creates a \"national framework for conserving\n\nand managing marine fisheries.\"            S. Rep. No. 104-276, at 2 (1996)\n\n(describing the history and purposes of the Act).                 It claims for\n\nthe federal government \"exclusive fishery management authority\" in\n\nouter    Continental     Shelf   waters     within   and   beyond    the   United\n\nStates's \"exclusive economic zone,\" which extends approximately 197\n\nnautical miles seaward from the three-mile boundary of state\n\njurisdiction.4     See 16 U.S.C. § 1811.              Within that exclusive\n\neconomic zone,     the    Act    further    claims   for   the    United   States\n\n\"sovereign rights . . . over all fish, and all Continental Shelf\n\nfishery resources.\"5        Id. § 1811(a); see also id. § 1801(c)(1)\n\n\n     4\n       The Magnuson-Stevens Act does not create this \"exclusive\neconomic zone,\" but rather incorporates by reference the 200-\nnautical mile exclusive economic zone that President Reagan created\nby executive order in 1983. See 16 U.S.C. § 1802(11); Proclamation\nNo. 5030, 48 Fed. Reg. 10,605 (Mar. 14, 1983). Congress, however,\nmodified that zone for purposes of the Magnuson-Stevens Act,\ndefining it to include only that portion of the original exclusive\neconomic zone that is seaward of the SLA boundary of state\njurisdiction. See § 1802(11); Massachusetts ex rel Div. of Marine\nFisheries v. Daley, 170 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 1999).\n     5\n       There is an exception, not relevant in this case, for the\nregulation of \"highly migratory\" fish species.    See 16 U.S.C.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f(declaring    Congress's   intent   \"to    maintain   without   change   the\n\nexisting territorial or other ocean jurisdiction of the United\n\nStates for all purposes other than the conservation and management\n\nof fishery resources\").\n\n          At the same time, the Magnuson-Stevens Act establishes\n\nthat the states enjoy the power to regulate fishing activities\n\nwithin their borders, including within the three-mile SLA boundary:\n\n\"[N]othing in this chapter shall be construed as extending or\n\ndiminishing the jurisdiction or authority of any State within its\n\nboundaries.\"6    16 U.S.C. § 1856(a)(1).       By so providing, Congress\n\n\"confirmed state jurisdiction over fisheries within a State's\n\ninternal waters and, for coastal states, out to the three-mile\n\nlimit.\" Davrod Corp. v. Coates, 971 F.2d 778, 786 (1st Cir. 1992);\n\nsee also Massachusetts ex rel Div. of Marine Fisheries v. Daley,\n\n170 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 1999) (Magnuson-Stevens Act, with limited\n\nexceptions, does not apply within state territorial waters).\n\nC.   Federal vs. State Jurisdiction in Nantucket Sound\n\n             Nantucket Sound, where the disputed tower has been built,\n\npresents special difficulties in distinguishing the respective\n\nspheres of state and federal jurisdiction.            Nantucket Sound is\n\nalmost completely enclosed by Massachusetts's territorial sea; only\n\n\n\n§ 1812.\n     6\n      Once again, there are certain exceptions not relevant in the\npresent case. E.g., 16 U.S.C. § 1856(b).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fat the extreme eastern end of the Sound does a channel of federal\n\nwater approximately one mile wide connect it to the open ocean.\n\nBut the Sound is a large body of water, and its center portion --\n\nincluding the site of Cape Wind's data tower on Horseshoe Shoals --\n\nis more than three miles from any coast.\n\n          Despite that fact, Massachusetts in the early 1970s took\n\nthe position that all of Nantucket Sound, including Horseshoe\n\nShoals, is within Massachusetts's territorial jurisdiction under\n\nthe doctrine of \"ancient title.\"    The Supreme Court rejected that\n\nclaim in United States v. Maine (Maine II), 475 U.S. 89 (1986),\n\nholding that the Commonwealth did not inherit title to the Sound\n\nfrom the British Crown.       Id. at 103.     After Maine II, it is\n\nincontrovertible that Cape Wind's data tower is located on the\n\nouter Continental Shelf, outside of Massachusetts's territorial\n\njurisdiction.   43 U.S.C. § 1331(a).\n\n          But there is a complication.      In 1984 -- while the Maine\n\nII litigation was pending -- Congress passed a bill defining all of\n\nNantucket Sound to be within the \"jurisdiction and authority\" of\n\nMassachusetts \"[f]or the purposes of\" the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n\nSee Pub. L. No. 98-623, § 404(4), 98 Stat. 3394, 3408 (Nov. 8,\n\n1984) (codified at 16 U.S.C. § 1856(a)(2)(B)).     In Davrod Corp. v.\n\nCoates, supra, this court held that § 1856(a)(2)(B) \"expressly\n\nconfirms\" Massachusetts's power to regulate the length of fishing\n\nvessels in Nantucket Sound.    See 971 F.2d at 786.     In this case,\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fTen    Taxpayer   contends    that     the   same   provision   authorizes\n\nMassachusetts to regulate the construction of Cape Wind's data\n\ntower, which Ten Taxpayer claims has the potential to affect\n\nfishing and fish habitats.\n\n                                     III.\n\nA.    Removal\n\n            With that background in mind, we turn to Ten Taxpayer's\n\narguments on appeal.       The first question is whether the district\n\ncourt should have remanded this case to the Barnstable Superior\n\nCourt for lack of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.7 Our review\n\nis de novo.     Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,\n\n142 F.3d 26, 33 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           Removal is permitted under 28 U.S.C. § 1441 in civil\n\nactions    over    which     the     district   courts   have   \"original\n\njurisdiction.\"    The Supreme Court has interpreted that requirement\n\nto bar removal unless the state action could have been filed in\n\nfederal court in the first instance. Sygenta Crop Protection, Inc.\n\n\n      7\n       Cape Wind also renews its argument that the plaintiffs lack\nstanding to bring this suit. We disagree. A Massachusetts statute\nexpressly allows groups like Ten Taxpayer to bring suit to enjoin\nenvironmental harms under any \"statute, ordinance, by-law or\nregulation the major purpose of which is to prevent or minimize\ndamage to the environment,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, § 7A, and the\nplaintiffs here (all of whom reside in towns bordering Nantucket\nSound and many of whom work in the Sound itself) allege\nsufficiently concrete and personal injuries from Cape Wind's\nactivities to support standing.       In addition, no party has\nsuggested that the appeal is moot because the SMDS has already been\nbuilt; indeed, Ten Taxpayer says that Massachusetts regulatory\nclearance for the project remains both available and required.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fv. Henson, 537 U.S. 28, 33 (2002); Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Graham, 489\n\nU.S. 838, 840 (1989) (per curiam); see also BIW Deceived v. Local\n\n56, 132 F.3d 824, 830 (1st Cir. 1997).              Here, the most obvious\n\nbases for federal subject-matter jurisdiction are lacking:                the\n\nparties are nondiverse, and Ten Taxpayer's complaint does not (at\n\nleast on its face) assert a cause of action based on federal law.\n\n              The question, accordingly, is whether any of several\n\nalternative bases for subject-matter jurisdiction applies.                  We\n\nreject the primary argument for removal offered by Cape Wind, but\n\nfind removal proper on a different ground.\n\n              1.    Delegation of Regulatory         Authority    Under    the\n                    Magnuson-Stevens Act\n\n             Cape Wind first relies on federal preemption under the\n\nMagnuson-Stevens Act.        It argues that Ten Taxpayer's claims \"arise\n\nunder\" federal law, and thus support removal under § 1441, because\n\nTen Taxpayer cannot prevail without showing that Congress in fact\n\ngranted to Massachusetts the authority to regulate on Horseshoe\n\nShoals.      This, Cape Wind argues, constitutes a \"federal question\"\n\non the face of Ten Taxpayer's well-pleaded complaint under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1331.\n\n             We disagree.       In this posture, the contention that\n\nfederal law does not authorize Ten Taxpayer's claims is simply a\n\nfederal preemption defense available to Cape Wind.            It is hornbook\n\nlaw   that    a    federal   defense   does   not   confer   \"arising   under\"\n\njurisdiction, regardless whether that defense is anticipated in the\n\n                                       -14-\n\fplaintiff's complaint.        Beneficial Nat'l Bank, 539 U.S. at 6;\n\nLouisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149, 152 (1908).\n\nThat is generally true even where the asserted defense is the\n\npreemptive effect of a federal statute.              Franchise Tax Bd. v.\n\nConstr. Laborers Vacation Tr., 463 U.S. 1, 12 (1983) (well-pleaded\n\ncomplaint rule may bar removal even where the only question for\n\ndecision is the viability of a federal preemption defense).\n\n             Cape Wind argues that the case at bar is distinguishable\n\nfrom an ordinary case involving a federal preemption defense\n\nbecause the question is not whether Congress precluded state\n\nregulation, but whether it affirmatively permitted it. The Supreme\n\nCourt rejected that precise argument in Gully v. First Nat'l Bank,\n\n299 U.S. 109 (1936).        In Gully, a state tax collector sued to\n\ncollect taxes from a national bank.          Id. at 111.    The bank tried to\n\nremove the case, arguing that if the state government had the power\n\nto collect taxes from a national bank, it enjoyed that power only\n\nto   the    extent   conferred   by   federal    statute.      Id.   at   112.\n\nTherefore, the bank argued, removal was proper because the state\n\ntax collector necessarily relied on federal law in bringing the\n\nsuit.      Id.   The Supreme Court rejected that reasoning:\n\n      The argument . . . proceeds on the assumption that,\n      because permission is at times preliminary to action, the\n      two are to be classed as one. But the assumption will\n      not stand . . . . Here, the right to be established is\n      one created by the state.        If that is so, it is\n      unimportant that federal consent is the source of state\n      authority. To reach the underlying law we do not travel\n      back so far. By unimpeachable authority, a suit brought\n\n                                      -15-\n\f      upon a state statute does not arise under an act of\n      Congress or the Constitution of the United States because\n      prohibited thereby. With no greater reason can it be\n      said to arise thereunder because permitted thereby.\n\nId. at 116 (citations omitted).             The same reasoning applies here.\n\nNo matter how the argument is framed, Cape Wind's contention that\n\nMassachusetts has no power to regulate on Horseshoe Shoals does not\n\nsupport removal.\n\n              2.   Federal Incorporation of State Law on the Outer\n                   Continental Shelf\n\n           For an entirely different reason, however, we hold that\n\nTen Taxpayer's claims do arise under federal law.                    That is because\n\nCongress   has     explicitly     incorporated      state      law    on   the   outer\n\nContinental Shelf as federal law:\n\n     To the extent they are applicable and not inconsistent\n     with this subchapter . . . , the civil and criminal laws\n     of each adjacent State, now in effect or hereinafter\n     adopted . . . are declared to be the law of the United\n     States for that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the\n     outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed\n     structures erected thereon, which would be within the\n     area of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward\n     to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf . . .\n     . All of such applicable laws shall be administered and\n     enforced by the appropriate officers and courts of the\n     United States.\n\n43   U.S.C.    §     1333(a)(2)    (emphasis      added).      Interpreting      this\n\nprovision,     the    Supreme     Court    has   held   that    \"federal     law   is\n\n'exclusive' in its regulation of this area, and . . . state law is\n\nadopted only as surrogate federal law.\" Rodrigue, 395 U.S. at 357;\n\nsee also Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.S. 473, 480\n\n(1981) (\"All law applicable to the Outer Continental Shelf is\n\n                                          -16-\n\ffederal law, but to fill the substantial 'gaps' in the coverage of\n\nfederal law, OCSLA borrows the 'applicable and not inconsistent'\n\nlaws of the adjacent States as surrogate federal law.\").\n\n           The consequence for Ten Taxpayer's complaint is clear.\n\nThe SMDS is a \"fixed structure[] erected\" on the \"subsoil and\n\nseabed of the outer Continental Shelf\" in territory adjacent to\n\nMassachusetts.      As   a   result,   the   Massachusetts   statutes    and\n\nregulations at issue in this case are, by federal statute, treated\n\nas federal law to the extent that they apply on Horseshoe Shoals.\n\nSee Union Texas Petroleum Corp. v. PLT Engineering, Inc., 895 F.2d\n\n1043, 1047 (5th Cir. 1990).\n\n           In its supplemental brief,8 Ten Taxpayer opposes this\n\ninterpretation of the OCSLA.      It contends that § 1333(a)(2) merely\n\nspecifies the rule of decision that should apply in cases brought\n\nunder 43   U.S.C.   §    1349(b)(1),   the   provision   that   grants   the\n\ndistrict courts subject-matter jurisdiction to hear cases arising\n\nfrom certain activities on the outer Continental Shelf.          Moreover,\n\nTen Taxpayer says, the OCSLA is predominantly concerned with oil\n\nand gas exploration on the outer Continental Shelf, and the Act's\n\nincorporation of state law must be understood in that context.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n       At oral argument, the court invited the parties to file\nsupplemental briefs directed to whether 43 U.S.C. § 1333(a)(2)\nsupports federal subject-matter jurisdiction in this case. Both\nparties accepted the invitation.\n\n                                   -17-\n\f             These arguments are unfounded.           The text of § 1333(a)(2)\n\nis unequivocal:       on the seabed of the outer Continental Shelf and\n\non any fixed structures attached thereto, the \"civil and criminal\n\nlaws of each adjacent State . . . are declared to be the law of the\n\nUnited States.\"       No reference is made to actions brought under\n\n§ 1349(b)(1).     On the contrary, Congress's explicit reference to\n\nstate criminal laws belies any suggestion that § 1333(a)(2) merely\n\ndefines the rule of decision for civil actions brought under\n\n§ 1349.   And Congress left no doubt that it expected the federal\n\ncourts to have control over the administration of adopted state\n\nlaws on the outer Continental Shelf.               See § 1333(a)(2) (\"All such\n\napplicable     laws   shall   be    administered       and    enforced   by   the\n\nappropriate officers and courts of the United States.\").\n\n          Likewise,       nothing         in   §     1333(a)(2)    limits     the\n\nincorporation of state law to activities involved in exploring for\n\noil and gas.9    Nor is there any reason to infer such a limitation,\n\nas Congress had good reason to adopt state law in its entirety\n\n(except where inconsistent with federal law).                   Federal law is\n\ninterstitial by its nature, and no other body of law applies on the\n\nouter Continental Shelf.           So rather than legislate for every\n\nconceivable     circumstance       that    might     arise,   Congress    simply\n\nincorporated state law, thereby simultaneously retaining federal\n\n\n     9\n       We express no view as to whether other provisions of the\nOCSLA are so limited. That question is implicated in a related\nappeal pending before this court. See supra note 1.\n\n                                      -18-\n\fcontrol over the outer Continental Shelf and ensuring that a\n\ncomprehensive body of substantive law will be available to resolve\n\ndisputes.    See Gulf Offshore, 453 U.S. at 480; Chevron Oil Co. v.\n\nHuson, 404 U.S. 97, 103 (1971); Rodrigue, 395 U.S. at 357.\n\n             We hold that Ten Taxpayer's claims, though ostensibly\n\npremised on Massachusetts law, arise under the \"law of the United\n\nStates\" under § 1333(a)(2). A federal question thus appears on the\n\nface of Ten Taxpayer's well-pleaded complaint.              See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§    1331.    Accordingly,   the   case   was   properly   removed.    Id.\n\n§ 1441(b); see Hufnagel v. Omega Serv. Indus., Inc., 182 F.3d 340,\n\n351 (5th Cir. 1999) (allowing removal because the plaintiff's state\n\nstatutory claim was incorporated as federal law under the OCSLA);\n\nHodges v. Shell Oil Co., No. Civ. A. 97-1573, 1997 WL 473809, at\n\n*3-*5 (E.D. La. Aug. 19, 1997) (same).10\n\nB.    Dismissal of Ten Taxpayer's Complaint\n\n             Having determined that the case was properly removed to\n\nfederal court, we turn to the question whether the district court\n\nproperly dismissed Ten Taxpayer's complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).     Once again, our review is de novo.           Peña-Borrero v.\n\nEstremeda, 365 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n       10\n       Because we hold that Ten Taxpayer's claims arise directly\nunder federal law, we do not decide whether the so-called Smith\ndoctrine, see Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180,\n199 (1921), or the doctrine of complete preemption, see Beneficial\nNat'l Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 6-7 (2003), would support\nfederal jurisdiction in this case.\n\n                                   -19-\n\f                 The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground\n\nthat the Magnuson-Stevens Act did not grant to the Commonwealth\n\nsufficiently broad authority to regulate the construction of a\n\ntower in federal waters in Nantucket Sound. See Ten Taxpayers, 278\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 100-01 (\"Congress did not delegate its complete\n\nsovereign authority over the pocket of federal waters in Nantucket\n\nSound       to   the   Commonwealth,   but    only    that   part   necessary    to\n\nestablish consistent fishing regulations throughout the Sound.\").\n\nOn appeal, the parties devote considerable attention to the same\n\nquestion.        Ten Taxpayer says that by placing Nantucket Sound under\n\nthe \"jurisdiction and authority\" of Massachusetts \"for the purposes\n\nof\" the Magnuson-Stevens Act, see 16 U.S.C. § 1856(a)(2), Congress\n\nmust    have      intended    to   empower   the     Commonwealth    to   regulate\n\nactivities on the seabed of Nantucket Sound that, like the SMDS,\n\nhave the potential to affect fishing.                Cape Wind responds, inter\n\nalia, that the \"purposes\" of the Magnuson-Stevens Act do not\n\ninclude regulation of structures attached to the seabed.\n\n                 We frame the issue differently.       Whatever Congress meant\n\nby its reference to \"the purposes of\" the Magnuson-Stevens Act in\n\n§   1856(a)(2),11       the   Massachusetts    statutes      at   issue   here   are\n\n\n       11\n       Congress may not have intended the phrase as a substantive\nrestriction. Section 1856(a)(2) defines the term \"jurisdiction and\nauthority of a State.\" In that context, a natural interpretation\nof the phrase \"[f]or the purposes of this chapter\" is simply that\nCongress wanted the definition stated in § 1856(a)(2) to apply\nthroughout the Magnuson-Stevens Act.    Congress employed similar\nlanguage in definitional clauses elsewhere in the Magnuson-Stevens\n\n                                       -20-\n\favailable on the outer Continental Shelf in any event as surrogate\n\nfederal   law,   provided   they    are    not   inconsistent    with   other\n\napplicable federal law.     43 U.S.C. § 1333(a)(2).       So the critical\n\nquestion for this court is not whether Congress gave Massachusetts\n\nthe authority to regulate on Horseshoe Shoals.            Rather, we must\n\ndecide (1) whether the Massachusetts statutes in question apply, by\n\ntheir own terms, to activities on Horseshoe Shoals; and (2) if they\n\ndo apply, whether their application to Cape Wind's construction of\n\nthe SMDS would be inconsistent with federal law.         We conclude that\n\nTen Taxpayer's complaint falters on both grounds.\n\n           1. Scope of the Asserted Massachusetts Statutes\n\n           First, we are extremely doubtful that the Massachusetts\n\nstatutes on which Ten Taxpayer relies apply to the SMDS site.\n\nObviously, no permit was required for the SMDS if Massachusetts has\n\nnot purported to regulate activities on that site.              Ten Taxpayer\n\nasserts claims under three Massachusetts statutes: Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nchapters 91, 130, and 132A.        On our reading of Massachusetts law,\n\nnone of those statutes applies to the erection of a tower on\n\nHorseshoe Shoals.\n\n           In Count I of its complaint, Ten Taxpayer asserts that\n\nCape Wind failed to comply with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 130.                  Ten\n\nTaxpayer is correct that chapter 130, which regulates fishing and\n\n\n\nAct. See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. § 1802(11); id. § 1821(e)(2)(A); id.\n§ 1823(c)(2).\n\n                                    -21-\n\fmarine fisheries in Massachusetts, applies broadly to \"all marine\n\nfisheries and fish within the jurisdiction of the commonwealth.\"\n\nId. § 1.   Ten Taxpayer's claim, however, arises under § 16, which\n\nis considerably more narrow: \"Any occupation under this chapter of\n\ntide waters or any work done therein, shall be subject to the\n\npertinent [permitting and licensing] provisions of chapter ninety-\n\none.\"\n\n           Significantly, the term \"tide waters\" is not defined in\n\nchapter 130 or in the implementing regulations, and there are no\n\npublished Massachusetts cases interpreting § 16.           Ten Taxpayer\n\nargues that \"tide waters\" embraces all waters \"subject to the rise\n\nand fall of the tides\" –- a definition that, it says, includes\n\nHorseshoe Shoals, where Coast Guard records indicate that the sea\n\ndepth varies by as much as three feet between high and low tides.\n\n           In   our   view,   that   interpretation   is    too   broad.\n\nMassachusetts cases referring to \"tide waters,\" \"tidal waters,\"\n\n\"tidewaters,\" and the like invariably concern developments in\n\nharbors or along the shoreline.      See, e.g., Trio Algario, Inc. v.\n\nComm'r of Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 795 N.E.2d 1148, 1151-53 (Mass.\n\n2003) (discussing wharves and other occupations of \"tide waters\");\n\nBoston Waterfront Dev. Corp. v. Massachusetts, 393 N.E.2d 356, 358\n\n(Mass. 1979) (describing \"the shores of the sea\" as \"tidal areas\");\n\nComm'r of Pub. Works v. Cities Serv. Oil Co., 32 N.E.2d 277, 281\n\n(Mass. 1941) (discussing the construction of piers and wharves as\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fthe \"erection of structures in tide waters\").               At most, the term\n\nrefers to the waters \"belong[ing] to the Commonwealth.\"                     Trio\n\nAlgario, 795 N.E.2d at 1153 n.9.               Ten Taxpayer relies on the\n\nancient case of Commonwealth v. Vincent, 108 Mass. 441 (1871),\n\nwhich opines that \"tide waters\" means \"waters, whether salt or\n\nfresh, wherever the ebb and flow of the tide from the sea is felt.\"\n\nId. at 447.     On its facts, however, that case involved only the\n\nquestion whether a pond on the mainland qualified as \"tide waters\"\n\nby   virtue    of    a   narrow   channel     connecting    it   to   the   sea.\n\nNotwithstanding the broad dictum, we do not think Vincent supports\n\nTen Taxpayer's sweeping notion that \"tide waters\" embraces any\n\nlocation where the depth of the sea is affected by the tides, even\n\nin waters that do not \"belong\" to the Commonwealth.                We conclude\n\nthat Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 130, § 16 is inapplicable to the SMDS site\n\nby its own terms.\n\n           In any event, even if § 16 were applicable on Horseshoe\n\nShoals, we would still conclude that no permit was required.                That\n\nis because § 16 merely subjects structures erected in the tide\n\nwaters to the \"pertinent provisions\" of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 91.\n\nChapter 91 requires a license from the Massachusetts Department of\n\nEnvironmental Protection (DEP) for structures built in protected\n\nwaters.   See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 310, § 9.05(1)(a).                The DEP's\n\nregulations,        however,   limit    this    licensing    and      permitting\n\nrequirement to activities in \"waterways\" and \"filled tidelands.\"\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fId. § 9.04.    Neither of those terms, as defined in the regulations,\n\nembraces Horseshoe Shoals.12       Consequently, Cape Wind was not\n\nobligated to seek a permit for its data tower under Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 91.\n\n            Finally,   Ten   Taxpayer    asserts   in   Count   II   of    its\n\ncomplaint that Cape Wind was required to obtain approval for the\n\nSMDS under the Massachusetts Ocean Sanctuaries Act, Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 132A.     Chapter 132A expressly provides that Nantucket Sound is\n\nwithin the Cape and Islands Ocean Sanctuary.            See id. § 13(c).\n\nWith few exceptions, the statute prohibits \"the building of any\n\nstructure on the seabed\" in any ocean sanctuary.          Id. § 15.       From\n\nthis, Ten Taxpayer concludes that Cape Wind erected the SMDS in\n\nviolation of chapter 132A.\n\n            The problem with this theory is that the Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Environmental Management (DEM), which is charged with\n\nimplementing the Ocean Sanctuaries Act, id. § 12C, including the\n\n\"care, oversight and control\" of ocean sanctuaries, id. § 14; Mass.\n\nRegs. Code tit. 302, § 5.09, has expressly disclaimed authority\n\n\n\n     12\n       Under DEP regulations, \"waterway\" means \"any area of water\nand associated submerged land or tidal flat lying below the high\nwater mark of any navigable river or stream, any Great Pond, or any\nportion of the Atlantic Ocean within the Commonwealth.\"       Mass.\nRegs. Code tit. 310, § 9.02 (emphasis added). Horseshoe Shoals is\nnot \"within the Commonwealth\" under the SLA, and nothing in the\nMagnuson-Stevens Act alters that fact.

In a letter to counsel for Ten Taxpayer\n\ndated January 24, 2002, Myron Gildesgame, the DEM's director of the\n\nOffice      of    Water      Resources     and     the   agency's   official   Ocean\n\nSanctuaries Coordinator,13 explained that the Cape and Islands Ocean\n\nSanctuary is not considered to include the Horseshoe Shoals area.\n\nAlthough chapter 132A purports to include Nantucket Sound in that\n\nsanctuary, that legislation was passed prior to the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Maine II.              Now, he concluded, \"jurisdiction over the\n\ncentral portion of the Sound, including Horseshoe Shoals, is with\n\nthe federal government.\"                 Gildesgame was even more explicit in\n\nresponse to a subsequent letter from Ten Taxpayer:\n\n       While I appreciate your legal research . . . relative to\n       state jurisdiction claims, the Department and the Ocean\n       Sanctuaries Program have not claimed jurisdiction over\n       the area of the sound which includes Horseshoe Shoals,\n       and respectfully decline to seek to expand our current\n       jurisdiction.\n\nThat     is      the   end    of   the    matter.

See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 302,\n§ 5.09(3).    The Coordinator is charged with carrying out the\nresponsibilities of the DEM under the Ocean Sanctuaries Act and is\nauthorized to perform or order investigations to determine whether\nparticular activities are consistent with chapter 132A.

Laws. ch. 132A.\n\n           2.    Inconsistency with Federal Law\n\n           There is a second reason why the district court was\n\ncorrect   to    dismiss   Ten    Taxpayer's   complaint.     Even     if   our\n\ninterpretation of state law is incorrect and one or more of the\n\ncited Massachusetts statutes does require a permit for the SMDS,\n\nthere is a further question:         whether that requirement should be\n\nincorporated     and    enforced    as   federal   law   under   43   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1333(a)(2)(A).       We conclude that it should not.\n\n           Under § 1333(a)(2)(A), the Massachusetts statutes cited\n\nby Ten Taxpayer apply on the outer Continental Shelf, if at all,\n\nsolely as surrogate federal law.         Id.; see also Gulf Offshore, 453\n\nU.S. at 480 (\"All law applicable to the Outer Continental Shelf is\n\nfederal law . . . .\").          But under the OCSLA, state laws are not\n\n\n\n     14\n        We recognize that under DEM regulations, it is the\nCommissioner of the DEM and not the Ocean Sanctuaries Coordinator\nwho is formally empowered to make determinations regarding the\napplicability of permit requirements to particular situations. See\nMass. Regs. Code tit. 302, § 5.09(4).        Nevertheless, we are\nsatisfied that Gildesgame's letters to counsel for Ten Taxpayer\nrepresent the official position of the DEM concerning the\nCommonwealth's jurisdiction over Horseshoe Shoals. Ten Taxpayer\nhas not disputed that the letters represent the agency's position.\nMoreover, prior to filing the instant lawsuit, Ten Taxpayer\nnotified both the Commissioner of the DEM and the Massachusetts\nAttorney General of its intent to sue. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n214, § 7A (requiring such notice). Despite this notice, neither\nthe Commissioner nor the Attorney General sought to intervene in\nthis action or initiate an enforcement proceeding against Cape\nWind.\n\n                                     -26-\n\fadopted as surrogate federal law to the extent that they are\n\n\"inconsistent with [the OCSLA] or with other Federal laws . . . .\"\n\nId.; see also Rodrigue, 395 U.S. at 355-56 (explaining that state\n\nlaw applies to fixed structures on the outer Continental Shelf\n\n\"only as federal law and then only when not inconsistent with\n\napplicable federal law\").\n\n          In our view, the OCSLA leaves no room for states to\n\nrequire licenses or permits for the erection of structures on the\n\nseabed on the outer Continental Shelf.    Congress retained for the\n\nfederal government the exclusive power to authorize or prohibit\n\nspecific uses of the seabed beyond three miles from shore.      See\n\n§ 1333(a)(3) (\"The provisions of this section for adoption of State\n\nlaw as the law of the United States shall never be interpreted as\n\na basis for claiming any interest in or jurisdiction on behalf of\n\nany State for any purpose over the seabed and subsoil of the outer\n\nContinental Shelf . . . .\").   If adopted and enforced on the outer\n\nContinental Shelf, statutes like Mass. Gen. Laws chs. 91 and 132A,\n\nwhich require the approval of state agencies prior to construction,\n\nwould effectively grant state governments a veto power over the\n\ndisposition of the national seabed.    That result is fundamentally\n\ninconsistent with the OCSLA.   See id. § 1332(3) (declaring it to be\n\nthe policy of the United States that \"the outer Continental Shelf\n\nis a vital national reserve held by the Federal Government for the\n\npublic, which should be made available for expeditious and orderly\n\n\n                                -27-\n\fdevelopment, subject to environmental safeguards, in a manner which\n\nis   consistent    with    the    maintenance     of   competition    and   other\n\nnational needs\" (emphasis added)).\n\n            Ten Taxpayer contends that the Magnuson-Stevens Act,\n\nwhich was     enacted     after   the   OCSLA,    changed   this     calculus   by\n\ndefining the \"body of water commonly known as Nantucket Sound\" to\n\nbe within the \"jurisdiction and authority\" of Massachusetts.                    See\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1856(a)(2)(B). Yet nothing in the Magnuson-Stevens Act\n\npurports to repeal or amend the OCSLA.             Cf. Passamaquoddy Tribe v.\n\nMaine, 75 F.3d 784, 790 (1st Cir. 1996) (implied repeal of federal\n\nstatutes is disfavored).          On the contrary, the two statutes can\n\nreadily coexist: the Magnuson-Stevens Act authorizes Massachusetts\n\nto regulate fishing-related conduct throughout Nantucket Sound, but\n\n\"the subsoil      and   seabed    of    the    outer   Continental    Shelf,    and\n\nartificial islands and fixed structures erected thereon,\" 43 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1333(a)(2)(A), remain the exclusive province of the federal\n\ngovernment.    Congress was perfectly clear in the Magnuson-Stevens\n\nAct that it did not intend to alter the rights of the United States\n\nin the outer Continental Shelf.                 See 16 U.S.C. § 1801(c)(1)\n\n(declaring it to be the policy of Congress in the Magnuson-Stevens\n\nAct \"to maintain without change the existing territorial or other\n\nocean jurisdiction of the United States for all purposes other than\n\nthe conservation and management of fishery resources\").\n\n\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\f          We conclude that any Massachusetts permit requirement\n\nthat might apply to the SMDS project is inconsistent with federal\n\nlaw and thus inapplicable on Horseshoe Shoals under the OCSLA. The\n\ndistrict court did not err in dismissing Ten Taxpayer's complaint.\n\n                               IV.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

This appeal is an early round in\n\nthe legal battle over whether a commercial wind energy farm may be\n\nbuilt in Nantucket Sound.\n\n          In October 2002, Ten Taxpayer Citizens Group and several\n\nadditional plaintiffs (together, Ten Taxpayer) filed a lawsuit in\n\nMassachusetts state court to prevent Cape Wind Associates from\n\nerecting a 197-foot data collection tower in Nantucket Sound.     The\n\ncomplaint alleged that Massachusetts state courts had jurisdiction\n\nover the project and that Cape Wind had failed to obtain the\n\nnecessary permits under state law. Cape Wind removed the action to\n\nfederal court and Ten Taxpayer moved to remand.      After denying the\n\nmotion to remand, the district court dismissed the complaint on\n\nAugust 19, 2003.\n\n          On appeal, Ten Taxpayer argues that the district court\n\nwas obligated to remand the case to state court for lack of federal\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.

Its   goal   is   to   construct   a\n\ncommercial windmill farm on Horseshoe Shoals, a shallow area of\n\nNantucket Sound more than three miles offshore.               The proposed\n\nwindmill farm includes at least 130 industrial wind turbines, each\n\n470 feet tall.      If it is completed as presently envisioned, the\n\nfacility will spread across 28 square miles of Nantucket Sound and\n\nwill be visible from shore.    The project is the first of its kind\n\nin North America.\n\n           To construct the wind farm, Cape Wind needs extensive\n\nmeteorological and oceanographic data concerning conditions on\n\nHorseshoe Shoals.       For that purpose, Cape Wind in late 2001\n\nannounced plans to build a \"scientific measurement device station\"\n\n(SMDS) on Horseshoe Shoals.    Intended as a temporary facility, the\n\nSMDS was designed to collect data for five years.        It would consist\n\nof a data tower rising approximately 200 feet in the air, supported\n\nby three steel pilings driven 100 feet into the seabed.           Together\n\nwith its tripodal support structure, the tower would occupy about\n\n900 square feet of ocean surface.\n\n           On August 19, 2002, the United States Army Corps of\n\nEngineers issued a permit to Cape Wind under § 10 of the Rivers and\n\nHarbors Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. § 401 et seq., for construction of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe SMDS.1    Cape Wind neither sought nor obtained permits for the\n\nSMDS project under Massachusetts law. A few weeks later, the Coast\n\nGuard issued a public notice that construction of the data tower\n\nwould commence on or about October 11, 2002.               Construction was\n\nbriefly delayed when Ten Taxpayer obtained a temporary restraining\n\norder from a state court in a related lawsuit.                 Ten Taxpayer\n\nvoluntarily    dismissed   that     suit,   however,    and   the   temporary\n\nrestraining order lapsed by its own terms.             On October 27, 2002,\n\nCape Wind began construction of the SMDS.         It is now complete and\n\nin operation.2\n\n             Ten Taxpayer filed this action in Barnstable Superior\n\nCourt on October 16, 2002, shortly before construction of the data\n\ntower began.     In its complaint, Ten Taxpayer acknowledged that the\n\nSMDS site is more than three miles from the nearest Massachusetts\n\nshoreline and that, accordingly, the location falls under the\n\njurisdiction of the federal government. Nevertheless, Ten Taxpayer\n\ncontended, Cape Wind could not build the SMDS without regulatory\n\napproval     from   Massachusetts    because    Congress      has   ceded   to\n\nMassachusetts the power to regulate any activity affecting fishing\n\nin Nantucket Sound.

Because Cape Wind did not\n\nobtain such approval, Ten Taxpayer alleged, the SMDS project was in\n\nviolation of Massachusetts law.      Ten Taxpayer sought an injunction\n\nblocking construction of the SMDS or, if the court would not enjoin\n\nconstruction, a $25,000 fine for every day that the SMDS remained\n\non Horseshoe Shoals.\n\n            Cape Wind immediately removed the case to federal court,\n\nasserting    that   federal   jurisdiction    was   proper   because   Ten\n\nTaxpayer's complaint, on its face, states a federal question --\n\ni.e., whether Congress has in fact delegated to Massachusetts the\n\nnecessary regulatory authority over Nantucket Sound.              In the\n\nalternative, Cape Wind argued that regardless of what Ten Taxpayer\n\nactually pleaded in its complaint, deciding Ten Taxpayer's state\n\nclaims would require resolution of a substantial question of\n\nfederal law, cf.

Further, the OCSLA provides a\n\nfederal cause of action for any person aggrieved by a violation of\n\nthose rules, id. § 1349(a)(1), and grants the federal district\n\ncourts jurisdiction to hear such cases, id. § 1349(b).               It is, in\n\nshort, a sweeping assertion of federal supremacy over the submerged\n\nlands outside of the three-mile SLA boundary.               See id. § 1332\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f(declaring it to be \"the policy of the United States that . . . the\n\nouter Continental Shelf is a vital national resource reserve held\n\nby the Federal Government for the public\" (emphasis added)).\n\n           In    1975,    the   Supreme     Court     confirmed    this   broad\n\nunderstanding of the OCSLA in Maine I.                The United States had\n\nbrought an original complaint in the Supreme Court against thirteen\n\nstates bordering the Atlantic Ocean, alleging that each state had\n\nclaimed some right or title in the outer Continental Shelf that was\n\ninconsistent with federal interests.               420 U.S. at 516-17.       In\n\nreply, the defendant states (including Massachusetts) had denied\n\nthe United States's title in the outer Continental Shelf, asserted\n\na variety of historical claims to the seabed beyond the SLA's\n\nthree-mile boundary, and urged the Court to overrule its decisions\n\nin California, Louisiana and Texas.              Id. at 517-19.    The Supreme\n\nCourt ruled for the United States, reaffirming that \"paramount\n\nrights\" in the seabed belong to the federal government as national\n\nsovereign.      Id. at 524.     The SLA, the Court acknowledged, had\n\ntransferred title to the states in a narrow band of the seabed.\n\nBut that statute did not alter the federal government's rights\n\noutside of that narrow band.         Id. at 526.          On the contrary, the\n\nCourt   explained,       Congress   in     the    OCSLA     had   \"emphatically\n\nimplemented its view that the United States has paramount rights to\n\nthe seabed beyond the three-mile limit.\"             Id.\n\nB.

The Act creates a \"national framework for conserving\n\nand managing marine fisheries.\"            S. Rep. No. 104-276, at 2 (1996)\n\n(describing the history and purposes of the Act).                 It claims for\n\nthe federal government \"exclusive fishery management authority\" in\n\nouter    Continental     Shelf   waters     within   and   beyond    the   United\n\nStates's \"exclusive economic zone,\" which extends approximately 197\n\nnautical miles seaward from the three-mile boundary of state\n\njurisdiction.4     See 16 U.S.C. § 1811.              Within that exclusive\n\neconomic zone,     the    Act    further    claims   for   the    United   States\n\n\"sovereign rights . . . over all fish, and all Continental Shelf\n\nfishery resources.\"5        Id. § 1811(a); see also id. § 1801(c)(1)\n\n\n     4\n       The Magnuson-Stevens Act does not create this \"exclusive\neconomic zone,\" but rather incorporates by reference the 200-\nnautical mile exclusive economic zone that President Reagan created\nby executive order in 1983. See 16 U.S.C. § 1802(11); Proclamation\nNo. 5030, 48 Fed. Reg. 10,605 (Mar. 14, 1983).

In 1984 -- while the Maine\n\nII litigation was pending -- Congress passed a bill defining all of\n\nNantucket Sound to be within the \"jurisdiction and authority\" of\n\nMassachusetts \"[f]or the purposes of\" the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n\nSee Pub.

Here, the most obvious\n\nbases for federal subject-matter jurisdiction are lacking:                the\n\nparties are nondiverse, and Ten Taxpayer's complaint does not (at\n\nleast on its face) assert a cause of action based on federal law.\n\n              The question, accordingly, is whether any of several\n\nalternative bases for subject-matter jurisdiction applies.                  We\n\nreject the primary argument for removal offered by Cape Wind, but\n\nfind removal proper on a different ground.\n\n              1.    Delegation of Regulatory         Authority    Under    the\n                    Magnuson-Stevens Act\n\n             Cape Wind first relies on federal preemption under the\n\nMagnuson-Stevens Act.        It argues that Ten Taxpayer's claims \"arise\n\nunder\" federal law, and thus support removal under § 1441, because\n\nTen Taxpayer cannot prevail without showing that Congress in fact\n\ngranted to Massachusetts the authority to regulate on Horseshoe\n\nShoals.      This, Cape Wind argues, constitutes a \"federal question\"\n\non the face of Ten Taxpayer's well-pleaded complaint under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1331.\n\n             We disagree.       In this posture, the contention that\n\nfederal law does not authorize Ten Taxpayer's claims is simply a\n\nfederal preemption defense available to Cape Wind.            It is hornbook\n\nlaw   that    a    federal   defense   does   not   confer   \"arising   under\"\n\njurisdiction, regardless whether that defense is anticipated in the\n\n                                       -14-\n\fplaintiff's complaint.

The Supreme\n\nCourt rejected that precise argument in Gully v. First Nat'l Bank,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102703\"><a href=\"/opinion/102703/gully-v-first-nat-bank-in-meridian/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1936).        In Gully, a state tax collector sued to\n\ncollect taxes from a national bank.          Id. at 111.    The bank tried to\n\nremove the case, arguing that if the state government had the power\n\nto collect taxes from a national bank, it enjoyed that power only\n\nto   the    extent   conferred   by   federal    statute.      Id.   at   112.\n\nTherefore, the bank argued, removal was proper because the state\n\ntax collector necessarily relied on federal law in bringing the\n\nsuit.      Id.   The Supreme Court rejected that reasoning:\n\n      The argument . . . proceeds on the assumption that,\n      because permission is at times preliminary to action, the\n      two are to be classed as one. But the assumption will\n      not stand . . . . Here, the right to be established is\n      one created by the state.        If that is so, it is\n      unimportant that federal consent is the source of state\n      authority. To reach the underlying law we do not travel\n      back so far. By unimpeachable authority, a suit brought\n\n                                      -15-\n\f      upon a state statute does not arise under an act of\n      Congress or the Constitution of the United States because\n      prohibited thereby. With no greater reason can it be\n      said to arise thereunder because permitted thereby.\n\nId. at 116 (citations omitted).             The same reasoning applies here.\n\nNo matter how the argument is framed, Cape Wind's contention that\n\nMassachusetts has no power to regulate on Horseshoe Shoals does not\n\nsupport removal.\n\n              2.   Federal Incorporation of State Law on the Outer\n                   Continental Shelf\n\n           For an entirely different reason, however, we hold that\n\nTen Taxpayer's claims do arise under federal law.                    That is because\n\nCongress   has     explicitly     incorporated      state      law    on   the   outer\n\nContinental Shelf as federal law:\n\n     To the extent they are applicable and not inconsistent\n     with this subchapter . . . , the civil and criminal laws\n     of each adjacent State, now in effect or hereinafter\n     adopted . . . are declared to be the law of the United\n     States for that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the\n     outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed\n     structures erected thereon, which would be within the\n     area of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward\n     to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf . . .\n     .

It contends that § 1333(a)(2) merely\n\nspecifies the rule of decision that should apply in cases brought\n\nunder 43   U.S.C.   §    1349(b)(1),   the   provision   that   grants   the\n\ndistrict courts subject-matter jurisdiction to hear cases arising\n\nfrom certain activities on the outer Continental Shelf.          Moreover,\n\nTen Taxpayer says, the OCSLA is predominantly concerned with oil\n\nand gas exploration on the outer Continental Shelf, and the Act's\n\nincorporation of state law must be understood in that context.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n       At oral argument, the court invited the parties to file\nsupplemental briefs directed to whether 43 U.S.C. § 1333(a)(2)\nsupports federal subject-matter jurisdiction in this case. Both\nparties accepted the invitation.\n\n                                   -17-\n\f             These arguments are unfounded.           The text of § 1333(a)(2)\n\nis unequivocal:       on the seabed of the outer Continental Shelf and\n\non any fixed structures attached thereto, the \"civil and criminal\n\nlaws of each adjacent State . . . are declared to be the law of the\n\nUnited States.\"       No reference is made to actions brought under\n\n§ 1349(b)(1).     On the contrary, Congress's explicit reference to\n\nstate criminal laws belies any suggestion that § 1333(a)(2) merely\n\ndefines the rule of decision for civil actions brought under\n\n§ 1349.   And Congress left no doubt that it expected the federal\n\ncourts to have control over the administration of adopted state\n\nlaws on the outer Continental Shelf.               See § 1333(a)(2) (\"All such\n\napplicable     laws   shall   be    administered       and    enforced   by   the\n\nappropriate officers and courts of the United States.\").\n\n          Likewise,       nothing         in   §     1333(a)(2)    limits     the\n\nincorporation of state law to activities involved in exploring for\n\noil and gas.9    Nor is there any reason to infer such a limitation,\n\nas Congress had good reason to adopt state law in its entirety\n\n(except where inconsistent with federal law).                   Federal law is\n\ninterstitial by its nature, and no other body of law applies on the\n\nouter Continental Shelf.           So rather than legislate for every\n\nconceivable     circumstance       that    might     arise,   Congress    simply\n\nincorporated state law, thereby simultaneously retaining federal\n\n\n     9\n       We express no view as to whether other provisions of the\nOCSLA are so limited.

See Ten Taxpayers, 278\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 100-01 (\"Congress did not delegate its complete\n\nsovereign authority over the pocket of federal waters in Nantucket\n\nSound       to   the   Commonwealth,   but    only    that   part   necessary    to\n\nestablish consistent fishing regulations throughout the Sound.\").\n\nOn appeal, the parties devote considerable attention to the same\n\nquestion.        Ten Taxpayer says that by placing Nantucket Sound under\n\nthe \"jurisdiction and authority\" of Massachusetts \"for the purposes\n\nof\" the Magnuson-Stevens Act, see 16 U.S.C. § 1856(a)(2), Congress\n\nmust    have      intended    to   empower   the     Commonwealth    to   regulate\n\nactivities on the seabed of Nantucket Sound that, like the SMDS,\n\nhave the potential to affect fishing.                Cape Wind responds, inter\n\nalia, that the \"purposes\" of the Magnuson-Stevens Act do not\n\ninclude regulation of structures attached to the seabed.\n\n                 We frame the issue differently.       Whatever Congress meant\n\nby its reference to \"the purposes of\" the Magnuson-Stevens Act in\n\n§   1856(a)(2),11       the   Massachusetts    statutes      at   issue   here   are\n\n\n       11\n       Congress may not have intended the phrase as a substantive\nrestriction. Section 1856(a)(2) defines the term \"jurisdiction and\nauthority of a State.\" In that context, a natural interpretation\nof the phrase \"[f]or the purposes of this chapter\" is simply that\nCongress wanted the definition stated in § 1856(a)(2) to apply\nthroughout the Magnuson-Stevens Act.    Congress employed similar\nlanguage in definitional clauses elsewhere in the Magnuson-Stevens\n\n                                       -20-\n\favailable on the outer Continental Shelf in any event as surrogate\n\nfederal   law,   provided   they    are    not   inconsistent    with   other\n\napplicable federal law.     43 U.S.C. § 1333(a)(2).       So the critical\n\nquestion for this court is not whether Congress gave Massachusetts\n\nthe authority to regulate on Horseshoe Shoals.            Rather, we must\n\ndecide (1) whether the Massachusetts statutes in question apply, by\n\ntheir own terms, to activities on Horseshoe Shoals; and (2) if they\n\ndo apply, whether their application to Cape Wind's construction of\n\nthe SMDS would be inconsistent with federal law.         We conclude that\n\nTen Taxpayer's complaint falters on both grounds.\n\n           1. Scope of the Asserted Massachusetts Statutes\n\n           First, we are extremely doubtful that the Massachusetts\n\nstatutes on which Ten Taxpayer relies apply to the SMDS site.\n\nObviously, no permit was required for the SMDS if Massachusetts has\n\nnot purported to regulate activities on that site.              Ten Taxpayer\n\nasserts claims under three Massachusetts statutes: Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nchapters 91, 130, and 132A.        On our reading of Massachusetts law,\n\nnone of those statutes applies to the erection of a tower on\n\nHorseshoe Shoals.\n\n           In Count I of its complaint, Ten Taxpayer asserts that\n\nCape Wind failed to comply with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 130.                  Ten\n\nTaxpayer is correct that chapter 130, which regulates fishing and\n\n\n\nAct. See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. § 1802(11); id. § 1821(e)(2)(A); id.\n§ 1823(c)(2).\n\n                                    -21-\n\fmarine fisheries in Massachusetts, applies broadly to \"all marine\n\nfisheries and fish within the jurisdiction of the commonwealth.\"\n\nId. § 1.   Ten Taxpayer's claim, however, arises under § 16, which\n\nis considerably more narrow: \"Any occupation under this chapter of\n\ntide waters or any work done therein, shall be subject to the\n\npertinent [permitting and licensing] provisions of chapter ninety-\n\none.\"\n\n           Significantly, the term \"tide waters\" is not defined in\n\nchapter 130 or in the implementing regulations, and there are no\n\npublished Massachusetts cases interpreting § 16.           Ten Taxpayer\n\nargues that \"tide waters\" embraces all waters \"subject to the rise\n\nand fall of the tides\" –- a definition that, it says, includes\n\nHorseshoe Shoals, where Coast Guard records indicate that the sea\n\ndepth varies by as much as three feet between high and low tides.\n\n           In   our   view,   that   interpretation   is    too   broad.\n\nMassachusetts cases referring to \"tide waters,\" \"tidal waters,\"\n\n\"tidewaters,\" and the like invariably concern developments in\n\nharbors or along the shoreline.      See, e.g., Trio Algario, Inc. v.\n\nComm'r of Dep't of Envtl.

At most, the term\n\nrefers to the waters \"belong[ing] to the Commonwealth.\"                     Trio\n\nAlgario, 795 N.E.2d at 1153 n.9.               Ten Taxpayer relies on the\n\nancient case of Commonwealth v. Vincent, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1871),\n\nwhich opines that \"tide waters\" means \"waters, whether salt or\n\nfresh, wherever the ebb and flow of the tide from the sea is felt.\"\n\nId. at 447.     On its facts, however, that case involved only the\n\nquestion whether a pond on the mainland qualified as \"tide waters\"\n\nby   virtue    of    a   narrow   channel     connecting    it   to   the   sea.\n\nNotwithstanding the broad dictum, we do not think Vincent supports\n\nTen Taxpayer's sweeping notion that \"tide waters\" embraces any\n\nlocation where the depth of the sea is affected by the tides, even\n\nin waters that do not \"belong\" to the Commonwealth.                We conclude\n\nthat Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 130, § 16 is inapplicable to the SMDS site\n\nby its own terms.\n\n           In any event, even if § 16 were applicable on Horseshoe\n\nShoals, we would still conclude that no permit was required.                That\n\nis because § 16 merely subjects structures erected in the tide\n\nwaters to the \"pertinent provisions\" of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 91.\n\nChapter 91 requires a license from the Massachusetts Department of\n\nEnvironmental Protection (DEP) for structures built in protected\n\nwaters.   See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 310, § 9.05(1)(a).                The DEP's\n\nregulations,        however,   limit    this    licensing    and      permitting\n\nrequirement to activities in \"waterways\" and \"filled tidelands.\"\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fId. § 9.04.    Neither of those terms, as defined in the regulations,\n\nembraces Horseshoe Shoals.12       Consequently, Cape Wind was not\n\nobligated to seek a permit for its data tower under Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 91.\n\n            Finally,   Ten   Taxpayer    asserts   in   Count   II   of    its\n\ncomplaint that Cape Wind was required to obtain approval for the\n\nSMDS under the Massachusetts Ocean Sanctuaries Act, Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 132A.     Chapter 132A expressly provides that Nantucket Sound is\n\nwithin the Cape and Islands Ocean Sanctuary.            See id. § 13(c).\n\nWith few exceptions, the statute prohibits \"the building of any\n\nstructure on the seabed\" in any ocean sanctuary.          Id. § 15.       From\n\nthis, Ten Taxpayer concludes that Cape Wind erected the SMDS in\n\nviolation of chapter 132A.\n\n            The problem with this theory is that the Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Environmental Management (DEM), which is charged with\n\nimplementing the Ocean Sanctuaries Act, id. § 12C, including the\n\n\"care, oversight and control\" of ocean sanctuaries, id. § 14; Mass.\n\nRegs. Code tit. 302, § 5.09, has expressly disclaimed authority\n\n\n\n     12\n       Under DEP regulations, \"waterway\" means \"any area of water\nand associated submerged land or tidal flat lying below the high\nwater mark of any navigable river or stream, any Great Pond, or any\nportion of the Atlantic Ocean within the Commonwealth.\"       Mass.\nRegs. Code tit. 310, § 9.02 (emphasis added). Horseshoe Shoals is\nnot \"within the Commonwealth\" under the SLA, and nothing in the\nMagnuson-Stevens Act alters that fact. Similarly, the SMDS is not\nlocated on \"filled tidelands,\" which are defined as \"former\nsubmerged lands and tidal flats which are no longer subject to\ntidal action due to the presence of fill.\" Id.\n\n                                  -24-\n\fover Horseshoe Shoals.              In a letter to counsel for Ten Taxpayer\n\ndated January 24, 2002, Myron Gildesgame, the DEM's director of the\n\nOffice      of    Water      Resources     and     the   agency's   official   Ocean\n\nSanctuaries Coordinator,13 explained that the Cape and Islands Ocean\n\nSanctuary is not considered to include the Horseshoe Shoals area.\n\nAlthough chapter 132A purports to include Nantucket Sound in that\n\nsanctuary, that legislation was passed prior to the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Maine II.              Now, he concluded, \"jurisdiction over the\n\ncentral portion of the Sound, including Horseshoe Shoals, is with\n\nthe federal government.\"                 Gildesgame was even more explicit in\n\nresponse to a subsequent letter from Ten Taxpayer:\n\n       While I appreciate your legal research . . . relative to\n       state jurisdiction claims, the Department and the Ocean\n       Sanctuaries Program have not claimed jurisdiction over\n       the area of the sound which includes Horseshoe Shoals,\n       and respectfully decline to seek to expand our current\n       jurisdiction.\n\nThat     is      the   end    of   the    matter.        Because    the   responsible\n\nMassachusetts agency has disclaimed regulatory authority over the\n\n\n\n\n       13\n        The Ocean Sanctuaries Coordinator is a position created\nunder the DEM's regulations.     See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 302,\n§ 5.09(3).    The Coordinator is charged with carrying out the\nresponsibilities of the DEM under the Ocean Sanctuaries Act and is\nauthorized to perform or order investigations to determine whether\nparticular activities are consistent with chapter 132A. Id.\n\n                                            -25-\n\fSMDS site,14 we hold that Cape Wind was not required to seek\n\napproval for the project under Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 132A.\n\n           2.    Inconsistency with Federal Law\n\n           There is a second reason why the district court was\n\ncorrect   to    dismiss   Ten    Taxpayer's   complaint.     Even     if   our\n\ninterpretation of state law is incorrect and one or more of the\n\ncited Massachusetts statutes does require a permit for the SMDS,\n\nthere is a further question:         whether that requirement should be\n\nincorporated     and    enforced    as   federal   law   under   43   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1333(a)(2)(A).       We conclude that it should not.\n\n           Under § 1333(a)(2)(A), the Massachusetts statutes cited\n\nby Ten Taxpayer apply on the outer Continental Shelf, if at all,\n\nsolely as surrogate federal law.         Id.; see also Gulf Offshore, 453\n\nU.S. at 480 (\"All law applicable to the Outer Continental Shelf is\n\nfederal law . . . .\").          But under the OCSLA, state laws are not\n\n\n\n     14\n        We recognize that under DEM regulations, it is the\nCommissioner of the DEM and not the Ocean Sanctuaries Coordinator\nwho is formally empowered to make determinations regarding the\napplicability of permit requirements to particular situations. See\nMass. Regs. Code tit. 302, § 5.09(4).        Nevertheless, we are\nsatisfied that Gildesgame's letters to counsel for Ten Taxpayer\nrepresent the official position of the DEM concerning the\nCommonwealth's jurisdiction over Horseshoe Shoals. Ten Taxpayer\nhas not disputed that the letters represent the agency's position.\nMoreover, prior to filing the instant lawsuit, Ten Taxpayer\nnotified both the Commissioner of the DEM and the Massachusetts\nAttorney General of its intent to sue. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n214, § 7A (requiring such notice). Despite this notice, neither\nthe Commissioner nor the Attorney General sought to intervene in\nthis action or initiate an enforcement proceeding against Cape\nWind.\n\n                                     -26-\n\fadopted as surrogate federal law to the extent that they are\n\n\"inconsistent with [the OCSLA] or with other Federal laws . . . .\"\n\nId.; see also Rodrigue, 395 U.S. at 355-56 (explaining that state\n\nlaw applies to fixed structures on the outer Continental Shelf\n\n\"only as federal law and then only when not inconsistent with\n\napplicable federal law\").\n\n          In our view, the OCSLA leaves no room for states to\n\nrequire licenses or permits for the erection of structures on the\n\nseabed on the outer Continental Shelf.    Congress retained for the\n\nfederal government the exclusive power to authorize or prohibit\n\nspecific uses of the seabed beyond three miles from shore.      See\n\n§ 1333(a)(3) (\"The provisions of this section for adoption of State\n\nlaw as the law of the United States shall never be interpreted as\n\na basis for claiming any interest in or jurisdiction on behalf of\n\nany State for any purpose over the seabed and subsoil of the outer\n\nContinental Shelf . . . .\").   If adopted and enforced on the outer\n\nContinental Shelf, statutes like Mass. Gen. Laws chs. 91 and 132A,\n\nwhich require the approval of state agencies prior to construction,\n\nwould effectively grant state governments a veto power over the\n\ndisposition of the national seabed.    That result is fundamentally\n\ninconsistent with the OCSLA.   See id. § 1332(3) (declaring it to be\n\nthe policy of the United States that \"the outer Continental Shelf\n\nis a vital national reserve held by the Federal Government for the\n\npublic, which should be made available for expeditious and orderly\n\n\n                                -27-\n\fdevelopment, subject to environmental safeguards, in a manner which\n\nis   consistent    with    the    maintenance     of   competition    and   other\n\nnational needs\" (emphasis added)).\n\n            Ten Taxpayer contends that the Magnuson-Stevens Act,\n\nwhich was     enacted     after   the   OCSLA,    changed   this     calculus   by\n\ndefining the \"body of water commonly known as Nantucket Sound\" to\n\nbe within the \"jurisdiction and authority\" of Massachusetts.                    See\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1856(a)(2)(B). Yet nothing in the Magnuson-Stevens Act\n\npurports to repeal or amend the OCSLA.             Cf. Passamaquoddy Tribe v.\n\nMaine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196568\"><a href=\"/opinion/196568/passamaquoddy-tribe-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 790 (1st Cir. 1996) (implied repeal of federal\n\nstatutes is disfavored).

Congress was perfectly clear in the Magnuson-Stevens\n\nAct that it did not intend to alter the rights of the United States\n\nin the outer Continental Shelf.                 See 16 U.S.C. § 1801(c)(1)\n\n(declaring it to be the policy of Congress in the Magnuson-Stevens\n\nAct \"to maintain without change the existing territorial or other\n\nocean jurisdiction of the United States for all purposes other than\n\nthe conservation and management of fishery resources\").\n\n\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\f          We conclude that any Massachusetts permit requirement\n\nthat might apply to the SMDS project is inconsistent with federal\n\nlaw and thus inapplicable on Horseshoe Shoals under the OCSLA.
