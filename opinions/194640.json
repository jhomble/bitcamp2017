John Pappalardo, United States Attorney, was on brief for\n                        \nappellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                        March 30, 1993\n                                         \n\n          ALDRICH,  Senior Circuit Judge.  Defendants Cronin,\n                                        \n\nStarck and Mendell were  variously convicted on some 15  of a\n\n20 count  indictment for  mail fraud and  inducing interstate\n\ntransportation to obtain property by fraud, 18 U.S.C.    1341\n\nand  2314.  Cronin was  sentenced as an  organizer or leader;\n\nStarck and Mendell as managers or supervisors.   They appeal,\n\nclaiming that the evidence did not warrant findings of guilt,\n\nor, in any event,  justify these added characterizations, and\n\nthat the orders for  restitution were excessive.  We  affirm,\n\nexcept as to the last.\n\n          The  fraud  involved  sales  of time  shares  in  a\n\nproposed Cape Cod resort, Village Green.  Although there were\n\nmany  subsidiary misrepresentations of consequence, the basic\n\nones  were   that  Village   Green  was  a   sound  long-term\n\ninvestment;  that  its  property,  then  a  motel,  would  be\n\nrenovated for the  1989 season; and that  it was a  member of\n\nRCI, Resort  Condominium International, Inc.   Membership  in\n\nRCI would permit exchanging  time at Village Green for  other\n\nresorts, and was a  most attractive inducement.  In  point of\n\nfact  Village Green had  no financing even  sufficient to get\n\noff the  ground; initial obligations  were not met,  and, not\n\nlong  after the  start, foreclosure  and bankruptcy  were not\n\nonly  inevitable,  but imminent.    Second,  with respect  to\n\nrenovation,  there was  no  bona fide  prospect of  financial\n\nability  to accomplish it.  Third, the sales pitch was larded\n\n                             -3-\n\nwith  RCI  posters;  brochures  were offered  many  customers\n\n(contrary  to RCI's instructions),  and the  sales agreements\n\nrecited   membership,  whereas,   in  fact,   the  membership\n\napplication was never  completed, and was  rejected.  In  sum\n\ntotal,  some  $272,000  was  collected of  which  little  was\n\nreturned,  with sales  continuing while  other protests  were\n\nignored.\n\n          Each defendant denies guilt, or, at the least, says\n\nthat the  others were more responsible.  According to Cronin,\n\n\"[T]he prosecution's  evidence amounted to  nothing more than\n\nmere association between defendant and the sales people (sic)\n\nwho  made the  misrepresentations. . .  .    The  prosecution\n\npresented  no substantial  evidence that  defendant had,  or,\n\nmore importantly, exercised control  over the manner in which\n\nthe  time shares were sold. . .   There was  no evidence that\n\ndefendant  read, reviewed, discussed,  or otherwise  knew the\n\ncontents of the sales documents. . .   The evidence was  that\n\nthe  salespeople   . . .  not  defendant,   told  prospective\n\npurchasers  that  Village Green  was  a member  of  RCI . . .\n\nThese  salespeople   were  under  the  direct   and  constant\n\nsupervision of Hart, the Project Director.\"\n\n          In point  of fact Cronin was the  originator of the\n\ndevelopment.   He had made contact with one Hatfield, who led\n\nhim  to  Starck  and  Mendell  to  provide  financing.    The\n\nfinancing was never  completed, as he knew, and Hatfield told\n\n                             -4-\n\nhim it was essential.   Cronin obtained a sizeable  six month\n\nloan  at 24%  interest  annually, subject  to endorsement  by\n\nStarck  and  Mendell.   He was  to  receive $400,000  for his\n\ncontribution to the  development, and was  said not to  share\n\nwith Starck and  Mendell as  owners because he  had had  some\n\ndifficulty at the  Registry of  Deeds.   He took  a note  and\n\nthird mortgage, which, surely, maintained his interest.\n\n          As  to Cronin's  innocence  of what  was going  on,\n\nHart, the  Project Director,  was partly  hired  by him,  and\n\nreported  to  him.    Cronin,  in  fact,  was  in  charge  of\n\nmarketing, and was said to be present every day.  He had been\n\nin  charge of marketing at an earlier development, and was no\n\namateur.   He  could not  help but  see  the RCI  posters and\n\nbrochures having,  in fact,  directed the installation  of an\n\nRCI room, and he told at least one salesman they were already\n\na member.   (Others said he  said it was  going through as  a\n\nmatter of course, which  was equally untrue.)  The  rosy view\n\npainted in his brief is not  what we consider.  The most that\n\nmight be said is that the enterprise may have started on good\n\nintentions,  but when that paving ran out it proceeded on the\n\nbacks of prone customers.\n\n          We  mention briefly Cronin's objection to testimony\n\nthat he instructed  the contract secretary to  place the name\n\nBernard Cohen on the weekly payroll request at $1,500, at the\n\nsame time  telling her that Cohen  was a dead friend  of his.\n\n                             -5-\n\nCronin  asserts  this  to  have been  irrelevant  and  highly\n\nprejudicial.  Rather, it was highly relevant.  In addition to\n\nshowing  that  Cronin  was  improperly  milking  the  scheme,\n\ncontrary to  his denial \"that money was  paid [him]\" (payroll\n\ndistributions were in cash), it showed the degree to which he\n\nwas in charge.  The court's finding that  relevancy prevailed\n\nover prejudice was well warranted.\n\n          We  pause here to say that enough has been shown to\n\njustify the court's finding, with reference to sentence, that\n\nCronin was an organizer or leader.  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(a).\n\n          Turning to Starck  and Mendell, they,  as trustees,\n\nwere  the  title  owners,  and had  personally  endorsed  the\n\npurchase note.  The jury  found in their favor on  some early\n\ncounts.   They contend, for this and other reasons, that they\n\ndid  not  \"devise  the  scheme.\"    Passing  the   fact  that\n\ndefendants  can take no  comfort from  inconsistent verdicts,\n\nHarris  v.  Rivera,  454 U.S.  339,  345  (1981),  it is  not\n                  \n\nnecessary that  a defendant be an original organizer.  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Serrano,  870 F.2d 1,  6 (1st Cir.  1989).  On  the\n                 \n\nissue  of the RCI alone there were ample incidents to warrant\n\nconscious deceit.  On top of this, these defendants could not\n\nhave been  ignorant of the many  financial difficulties that,\n\nin due course, presaged ruin.\n\n          As  to   the  sentencing  increase   because  these\n\ndefendants were found to be managers or supervisors, U.S.S.G.\n\n                             -6-\n\n  3B1.1(b), Starck  and Mendell were, after  all, the owners.\n\nWe review  only  for clear  error,  United States  v.  Panet-\n                                                             \n\nCollazo, 960 F.2d 256, 261 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.,\n                                                            \n\nDiaz v. United States, 113 S.Ct. 220 (1992), and we see none.\n                     \n\nManifestly they  cannot  deny responsibility  for  deliberate\n\nmisrepresentation by salesmen of  which they were aware, even\n\nto the point  of receiving complaints,  simply on the  ground\n\nthat they were not  the ones who devised the procedure.  This\n\nwould be a happy day for vendors with loose consciences.  The\n\nrecord   is   replete   with   misrepresentations,   and   of\n\ndefendants', at  least  occasional,  awareness  and  lack  of\n\nconcern.\n\n          With  reference  to sentences,  Starck  and Mendell\n\ncomplain  that  the  court   charged  them  with  points  for\n\nobstructing  justice  by  committing  perjury.     Our  prior\n\nrejection  of  this  contention,  United  States v.  Batista-\n                                                             \n\nPolanco, 927 F.2d 14,  21-22 (1st Cir. 1991), has  since been\n       \n\nconfirmed.   United  States  v. Dunnigan,  122  L. Ed.2d  445\n                                        \n\n(1993).\n\n          Next, defendants  complain  that their  scheme  had\n\ncommenced  prior  to  the  Guidelines.    As  to  the  prison\n\nsentences, they  were concurrent, and even  though mail fraud\n\ncounts are separate offenses, see United States v. Lilly, 983\n                                                        \n\nF.2d   300  (1st  Cir.  1992),  there   can  be  no  possible\n\nconstitutional question.   There  is a problem,  though, with\n\n                             -7-\n\nregard to restitution.  Although Starck  and Mendell state in\n\ntheir brief that  the court ordered restitution for  the full\n\namount obtained, this was not  so individually.  No defendant\n\nwas convicted on  all counts,  and as to  each defendant  the\n\ncourt  ordered deducted from the full amount the counts as to\n\nwhich he  had been acquitted.   This, however,  still charged\n\nhim  for more than  the counts on  which he was  convicted --\n\nthere  had been  much more  collected than  was named  in the\n\nindictment's  20  counts.    The government  argued  that  in\n\ndetermining the length of  sentence it was proper to  look at\n\nthe entire picture.   This is correct, United States  v. Fox,\n                                                            \n\n889 F.2d  357 (1st  Cir. 1989);  indeed, even  to considering\n\noffenses  found by  the court  though there  had been  a jury\n\nacquittal.  United States  v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13,  17 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir.  1989).   This,  however, is  for enhancement  of prison\n\nterms  within  the guidelines.    Restitution  is a  separate\n\nmatter.  18 U.S.C.    3663.  In United States v.  Hughey, 495\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 411  (1990), the defendant, charged,  in several counts,\n\nwith  the  use of  stolen credit  cards,  pled guilty  to the\n\nfraudulent  use of one.   The order  for restitution included\n\nuse  of others.  The  Court reversed, saying  the outer limit\n\nwas \"the loss caused by the conduct underlying the offense of\n\nconviction.\"   Id. at 420.   This decision,  however, did not\n                 \n\nentirely clear the air, and the circuits have split as to its\n\napplication in mail fraud cases.\n\n                             -8-\n\n          As of  the moment, five circuits  have answered, or\n\nappear disposed  to answer, that the  \"offense of conviction\"\n\nis  the particular  mailing charged.

Defendants Cronin,\n                                        \n\nStarck and Mendell were  variously convicted on some 15  of a\n\n20 count  indictment for  mail fraud and  inducing interstate\n\ntransportation to obtain property by fraud, 18 U.S.C.    1341\n\nand  2314.  Cronin was  sentenced as an  organizer or leader;\n\nStarck and Mendell as managers or supervisors.   They appeal,\n\nclaiming that the evidence did not warrant findings of guilt,\n\nor, in any event,  justify these added characterizations, and\n\nthat the orders for  restitution were excessive.  We  affirm,\n\nexcept as to the last.\n\n          The  fraud  involved  sales  of time  shares  in  a\n\nproposed Cape Cod resort, Village Green.  Although there were\n\nmany  subsidiary misrepresentations of consequence, the basic\n\nones  were   that  Village   Green  was  a   sound  long-term\n\ninvestment;  that  its  property,  then  a  motel,  would  be\n\nrenovated for the  1989 season; and that  it was a  member of\n\nRCI, Resort  Condominium International, Inc.   Membership  in\n\nRCI would permit exchanging  time at Village Green for  other\n\nresorts, and was a  most attractive inducement.  In  point of\n\nfact  Village Green had  no financing even  sufficient to get\n\noff the  ground; initial obligations  were not met,  and, not\n\nlong  after the  start, foreclosure  and bankruptcy  were not\n\nonly  inevitable,  but imminent.    Second,  with respect  to\n\nrenovation,  there was  no  bona fide  prospect of  financial\n\nability  to accomplish it.  Third, the sales pitch was larded\n\n                             -3-\n\nwith  RCI  posters;  brochures  were offered  many  customers\n\n(contrary  to RCI's instructions),  and the  sales agreements\n\nrecited   membership,  whereas,   in  fact,   the  membership\n\napplication was never  completed, and was  rejected.  In  sum\n\ntotal,  some  $272,000  was  collected of  which  little  was\n\nreturned,  with sales  continuing while  other protests  were\n\nignored.\n\n          Each defendant denies guilt, or, at the least, says\n\nthat the  others were more responsible.  According to Cronin,\n\n\"[T]he prosecution's  evidence amounted to  nothing more than\n\nmere association between defendant and the sales people (sic)\n\nwho  made the  misrepresentations. . .  .    The  prosecution\n\npresented  no substantial  evidence that  defendant had,  or,\n\nmore importantly, exercised control  over the manner in which\n\nthe  time shares were sold. . .   There was  no evidence that\n\ndefendant  read, reviewed, discussed,  or otherwise  knew the\n\ncontents of the sales documents. . .   The evidence was  that\n\nthe  salespeople   . . .  not  defendant,   told  prospective\n\npurchasers  that  Village Green  was  a member  of  RCI . . .\n\nThese  salespeople   were  under  the  direct   and  constant\n\nsupervision of Hart, the Project Director.\"\n\n          In point  of fact Cronin was the  originator of the\n\ndevelopment.   He had made contact with one Hatfield, who led\n\nhim  to  Starck  and  Mendell  to  provide  financing.    The\n\nfinancing was never  completed, as he knew, and Hatfield told\n\n                             -4-\n\nhim it was essential.   Cronin obtained a sizeable  six month\n\nloan  at 24%  interest  annually, subject  to endorsement  by\n\nStarck  and  Mendell.   He was  to  receive $400,000  for his\n\ncontribution to the  development, and was  said not to  share\n\nwith Starck and  Mendell as  owners because he  had had  some\n\ndifficulty at the  Registry of  Deeds.   He took  a note  and\n\nthird mortgage, which, surely, maintained his interest.\n\n          As  to Cronin's  innocence  of what  was going  on,\n\nHart, the  Project Director,  was partly  hired  by him,  and\n\nreported  to  him.    Cronin,  in  fact,  was  in  charge  of\n\nmarketing, and was said to be present every day.  He had been\n\nin  charge of marketing at an earlier development, and was no\n\namateur.   He  could not  help but  see  the RCI  posters and\n\nbrochures having,  in fact,  directed the installation  of an\n\nRCI room, and he told at least one salesman they were already\n\na member.   (Others said he  said it was  going through as  a\n\nmatter of course, which  was equally untrue.)  The  rosy view\n\npainted in his brief is not  what we consider.  The most that\n\nmight be said is that the enterprise may have started on good\n\nintentions,  but when that paving ran out it proceeded on the\n\nbacks of prone customers.\n\n          We  mention briefly Cronin's objection to testimony\n\nthat he instructed  the contract secretary to  place the name\n\nBernard Cohen on the weekly payroll request at $1,500, at the\n\nsame time  telling her that Cohen  was a dead friend  of his.\n\n                             -5-\n\nCronin  asserts  this  to  have been  irrelevant  and  highly\n\nprejudicial.  Rather, it was highly relevant.  In addition to\n\nshowing  that  Cronin  was  improperly  milking  the  scheme,\n\ncontrary to  his denial \"that money was  paid [him]\" (payroll\n\ndistributions were in cash), it showed the degree to which he\n\nwas in charge.  The court's finding that  relevancy prevailed\n\nover prejudice was well warranted.\n\n          We  pause here to say that enough has been shown to\n\njustify the court's finding, with reference to sentence, that\n\nCronin was an organizer or leader.  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(a).\n\n          Turning to Starck  and Mendell, they,  as trustees,\n\nwere  the  title  owners,  and had  personally  endorsed  the\n\npurchase note.  The jury  found in their favor on  some early\n\ncounts.   They contend, for this and other reasons, that they\n\ndid  not  \"devise  the  scheme.\"    Passing  the   fact  that\n\ndefendants  can take no  comfort from  inconsistent verdicts,\n\nHarris  v.

Congress, meanwhile, since defendants'\n\noffenses,  has   amended  the  statute  in   favor  of  broad\n\nrestitution.1   Under  these  circumstances  we forego  total\n\nanalysis, and  for the brief pre-amendment  period covered by\n\nthe present case are content  to accept the lenient  majority\n\nview.   The  sentence  with respect  to  restitution must  be\n\nlimited  to the amounts in the counts on which the particular\n\ndefendant was found guilty.\n\n          Affirmed, except remanded  for correction of orders\n                                                             \n\nfor restitution in accordance with this opinion.\n                                               \n\n                    \n\n1.        (2)  For the purposes  of restitution,  a\n          victim of an offense that involves as  an\n          element  a  scheme,  a  conspiracy,  or a\n          pattern  of  criminal activity  means any\n          person directly harmed by the defendant's\n          criminal conduct  in  the course  of  the\n          scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\n\n  3663(a)(2).
