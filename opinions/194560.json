Defendant  asserts that the district court\n          Per Curiam.\n                    \n\ncommitted reversible error  in its bench-trial ruling  precluding\n\nthe following inquiry of defendant's expert: \n\n               Doctor, could that severe  manic episode\n          you  testified Eric suffered from at the time\n          of the  offense have caused him  to have been\n          unable to appreciate  the nature and  quality\n          or the wrongfulness of his acts?\n\nFor several reasons,  we believe the issue  defendant attempts to\n\nraise on appeal need not be reached.1\n\n          First, though it sustained the government's Rule 704(b)\n\nobjection, the district court did not preclude the  quoted inqui-\n\nry.   Rather,  the court  went on  to state:   \"You  can ask  the\n\nquestion for whatever weight the Court wishes to give it. . . .\"2\n\n          Second,  and  more to  the  point,  the district  court\n\nexpressly found that there  was insufficient evidence that defen-\n\ndant  suffered from \"a severe  mental disease or  defect\" when he\n\n                    \n\n     1The  sole basis for the  appeal is that  the district court\nmisapplied Federal Evidence Rule 704(b), which provides:\n\n         (b)   No expert witness testifying  with respect to\n     the  mental  state or  condition  of a  defendant  in a\n     criminal case may  state an opinion or  inference as to\n     whether  the defendant did  or did not  have the mental\n     state or condition constituting an element of the crime\n     charged or  of a defense thereto.  Such ultimate issues\n     are matters for the trier of fact alone.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 704(b).\n\n     2The Court further  explained:  \"The  point being that  it's\nthe trier of fact  that makes that ultimate factual  decision and\nnot the expert under 704.\"\n\nrobbed the bank.   Absent an appellate challenge to  the district\n\ncourt's predicate finding, and there is none, there can have been\n\nno  error  in the  exclusion  of  defense counsel's  hypothetical\n\nquestion.\n\n          Third, all else aside, the  ruling is firmly rooted  in\n\nRule 702, which empowers  the court to allow expert  testimony if\n\nit could  \"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or\n\nto determine a fact in issue. . . .\"  Fed. R.  Evid. 702.  As the\n\ntrier of  fact, the district  court judge simply  determined that\n\nthe proffered expert testimony would not aid its determination of\n\nthe ultimate issue.  There could be no abuse of discretion in its\n\nRule 702  exclusion, particularly in  view of  its invitation  to\n\nproceed with the  testimony for whatever  weight the court  might\n\ndecide to give it.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                                3\n",
