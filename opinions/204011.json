This unusual First Amendment case\n\ngrows out of a dispute over access to government channels of\n\nwritten and electronic communication to conduct an ongoing debate\n\nover government spending in the Town of Epping, New Hampshire.\n\n            A citizens group that advocates reduced spending, Epping\n\nResidents   for   Principled   Government   (\"ERPG\"),   along   with   its\n\nchairman Thomas Sutliffe and another member, in 2006 brought this\n\nsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against various Town and school\n\nofficial defendants.1    The complaint was later amended in 2007 to\n\nadd as plaintiffs three other Town residents who were unaffiliated\n\nwith ERPG. Plaintiffs claimed that defendants violated their First\n\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights when defendant Town and school\n\nofficials advocated for approval of budgets and spending on school\n\nand Town purposes through school and Town newsletters, mailings,\n\nand other forms of communication including the Town website, while\n\ndenying plaintiffs access to these same communication channels to\n\nexpress their opposing views.\n\n            The district court, in 2008, dismissed the claims of the\n\nthree added plaintiffs for lack of standing.       Sutliffe v. Epping\n\nSch. Dist. (Sutliffe III), No. 06-cv-474, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2008\n\n\n\n     1\n          These included the Town and its Board of Selectmen\n(collectively the \"Town defendants\"), as well as the Epping School\nDistrict, its superintendent, the school district moderator, the\nprincipal of Epping Elementary School, and current and former\nmembers of the Epping School Board (collectively the \"school\ndefendants\").\n\n                                  -3-\n\fWL 939183, at *6-7 (D.N.H. Apr. 4, 2008).                 It also dismissed the\n\nbulk     of   the   original   plaintiffs'      claims    on    res    judicata   and\n\ncollateral estoppel grounds, in light of a similar suit that\n\nplaintiffs had previously brought -- and lost -- in state court.\n\nId. at *5-13.        In a separate order later that year, the district\n\ncourt     granted    summary    judgment      to    defendants    on    plaintiffs'\n\nremaining claims, concerning the Town website. Sutliffe v. Town of\n\nEpping (Sutliffe IV), No. 06-cv-474, 2008 WL 4922348 (D.N.H. Nov.\n\n13, 2008).      We now affirm the rulings in both orders.\n\n                                         I.\n\n              ERPG, which describes itself as \"a perennial thorn in\n\n[the Town's] side,\" has been engaged in a longstanding effort to\n\ncurb what it sees as \"profligate spending\" by the Town and its\n\nschool district.\n\n              As part of this effort, on January 31, 2005, in the lead-\n\nup   to   the   March    8,    2005,   local       elections,   ERPG's    chairman,\n\nSutliffe, sent a letter to the Epping School Board, accusing the\n\nschool board of using public resources to engage in one-sided\n\nadvocacy in certain unspecified mailers sent prior to the previous\n\nyear's election.         The letter also cited the Epping Elementary\n\nSchool newsletter, Cool News, which it claimed gave an unfair voice\n\nto   a    private    organization      called      the   Epping   Advocates;      the\n\nnewsletter listed the address for the Advocates' website, which\n\npromoted a certain view (allegedly favorable to that of the school\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fboard) on the issues and candidates presented in the 2004 election.\n\nERPG's letter demanded that the school board afford a similar\n\nopportunity to \"those residents who hold a different point of view\n\non matters advocated by your Board\" and that all such materials\n\ndistributed in the future, particularly with regard to the March\n\n2005 election and future elections, \"include both sides of [the]\n\nissue.\"\n\n          Sutliffe had sent a similar letter on behalf of ERPG on\n\nJanuary 29, 2005, to the Town's Board of Selectmen.     The letter\n\naccused the selectmen of producing and distributing, using public\n\nfunds, a \"flyer which . . . advocated the passage of certain\n\nwarrant articles\" before the previous election. As with the school\n\nboard, the letter demanded that the Board of Selectmen provide ERPG\n\nwith an opportunity to express its opposing opinion in any future\n\nmaterials from the selectmen, specifically those relating to the\n\nupcoming March 2005 election.   Neither the school board nor the\n\nselectmen acceded to ERPG's demands.\n\nA.        The New Hampshire State Court Litigation\n\n          In response, on March 3, 2005, just days before the\n\nelection, Sutliffe and ERPG filed a pro se, ex parte petition for\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief against both boards and their\n\nrespective chairpersons (collectively the \"state court defendants\")\n\nin the Rockingham County Superior Court.    The petition sought to\n\nenjoin the school board from sending any further mailings on issues\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fpertaining to the election \"without allowance for inclusion of a\n\ndiffering viewpoint\" and to grant ERPG a \"rebuttal mailing to be\n\nsent to all Epping residents prior to the March 8, 2005 election,\n\nat the School District's expense.\"         It also requested that the\n\ncourt require the selectmen, before the March 8 election, to send\n\nan addendum to the 2004 annual report2 with ERPG's views, again at\n\nthe Town's expense.    Failing this, the petition asked the court to\n\ndelay the election.\n\n           The petition asserted that the state court defendants had\n\nviolated   the   New   Hampshire    Constitution   and   the   First   and\n\nFourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution by \"expend[ing]\n\npublic monies for purposes of promoting or advocating a particular\n\nposition on an election measure or issue.\"          In support of this\n\nclaim, ERPG's petition cited the 2004 annual report, which included\n\nsections written by both the school board and the selectmen.           ERPG\n\nclaimed that both sections contained advocacy in favor of the\n\npassage of certain warrant articles that were up for consideration\n\nin 2004.   ERPG pointed to two statements in the section prepared by\n\nthe school board's chairperson:        (1) \"We ask for your support of\n\nthe three year paraprofessional contract and the warrant article\n\ngeneral maintenance items.\"        And (2) on another warrant article,\n\n\"As always, your affirmative vote on the school budget is vitally\n\n\n     2\n          The selectmen and the school board produce an annual\nreport, which includes budget details, meeting minutes, and other\ninformation from committees, auditors, and department heads.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fimportant.    This appropriation is the money needed to effectively\n\nrun our schools on a day to day basis.\"         ERPG also objected to\n\nmaterial in the selectmen's portion, which contained a report by\n\nthe police chief on another warrant article that stated:\n\n           I am not convinced that we can accomplish the\n           mission of this department with the current\n           staffing and ask the town to support our needs\n           as we take on additional duties each year.\n           Your support is vital and I am asking you\n           again this year to vote favorably for the\n           addition to our police force.\n\n           Plaintiffs'   objections    went   beyond   the   2004   annual\n\nreport.    The petition also cited Sutliffe's January 29 and 31\n\nletters.     It alleged that, in spite of its requests, the school\n\nboard sent three mailings in the month that followed, along with\n\nnumerous flyers sent home with students, all without giving ERPG a\n\nchance to express its viewpoint.      The petition did not explicitly\n\nreference the Cool News newsletter or any other specific materials.\n\n           The superior court rejected plaintiffs' request for ex\n\nparte relief on March 3, 2005, the same day the petition was filed.\n\nRealizing that they would be unable to attain relief before the\n\nMarch 8 election, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the\n\npetition on March 4.     In place of the relief requested in the ex\n\nparte petition, the amended petition requested that the court: (1)\n\nfind that the 2003 and 2004 annual reports contained unwarranted\n\nadvocacy and thus constituted invalid expenditures of public funds;\n\n(2) enjoin \"all Epping public officials in the future from their\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fcontinued use of unwarranted advocacy,\" as required by the New\n\nHampshire and U.S. Constitutions; and (3) order that the 2005 and\n\n2006 annual reports contain a statement advising citizens on the\n\nimpermissibility of advocacy with the use of public funds.\n\n          On June 1, 2005, the superior court conducted a bench\n\ntrial on the relief requested in the amended petition.       At the\n\ntrial, the plaintiffs submitted a packet of materials labeled as\n\nExhibit 1. These materials included copies of the Cool News school\n\nnewsletter from February and March 2004; school mailers from March\n\n9, 2004, and March 8, 2005; photographs showing blueprints and a\n\nmodel of a proposed school addition which had been placed at the\n\npolls in the March 8, 2005 election; statements detailing the cost\n\nof mailing certain school flyers in 2004; and a March 1, 1996,\n\nmemorandum to the Epping School District prepared by its attorney\n\nregarding the use of public funds for advocacy.3\n\n          The superior court admitted these exhibits into evidence,\n\nbut stated that it would limit its review to the Town and school\n\nboard statements to which the plaintiffs had referred in their\n\n\n     3\n          The memorandum was prepared in response to a letter sent\nin 1996 to various school districts, including the Epping School\nDistrict, on behalf of the Granite State Taxpayers Association.\nThe Association's letter apparently asserted that it was illegal\nfor the school boards to comment on an upcoming state senate bill.\nThe memorandum, in response, recommended that school district\nrefrain from expending public funds on \"campaign material\" but\nadded that it was not impermissible for school boards to make\nrecommendations regarding warrant articles or use public funds to\neducate the public about an election issue or for elected officials\nto express their views on issues confronting their community.\n\n                               -8-\n\fpetition.4    Plaintiffs explained that the materials were intended\n\n\"to give . . . some background basically on what transpired because\n\nthis all started in the year 2004.\"       The evidence illustrated how\n\nthe plaintiffs \"were denied . . . from all angles[,] from the\n\nselectmen, the school committee, from any other planning board or\n\nconservation commission.\"     The court again clarified that it would\n\nonly \"address the denials that are contained in [the] petition,\"\n\nand the plaintiffs agreed to this limitation.\n\n             On June 15, 2005, the superior court issued a decision\n\ndenying plaintiffs' request for declaratory judgment and injunctive\n\nrelief.     It ruled that the statements in the 2004 annual report\n\n\"were made by elected public officials speaking on behalf of their\n\nrespective    public   entities\"   and   \"in   furtherance   of   a   public\n\npurpose.\"     Epping Residents for Principled Gov't, Inc. v. Epping\n\nSch. Bd. (Sutliffe I), No. 05-E-0094, slip op. at 3 (N.H. Super.\n\nCt. June 15, 2005).     Thus, the statements cited in the plaintiffs'\n\npetition did not violate the New Hampshire Constitution.          Id.    The\n\ncourt also concluded that the statements did not violate the First\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments because the \"United States Supreme Court\n\n\n     4\n          At the hearing, in response to the plaintiffs' submission\nof the materials in Exhibit 1, the court told the plaintiffs:\n     You have submitted a great deal of material. . . . I just\n     can't have a declaratory judgment that is open-ended\n     [such that] every time someone sends out a letter, I have\n     to decide [whether it is legal]. In other words, the\n     only thing I am going to decide is whether the material\n     referenced in your original petition is legal . . . to\n     send [out].\n\n                                   -9-\n\fhas made it clear that the government may use public funds to\n\nendorse its own measures.\"        Sutliffe I, slip op. at 4-5 (citing\n\nJohanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass'n, 544 U.S. 550, 553 (2005)).\n\n           Plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied\n\nby the superior court on July 19, 2005.         The motion to reconsider\n\nasserted that the superior court's June 15 decision contained\n\nvarious legal and factual errors. It did not assert, however, that\n\nthe   superior   court   had   erred   in   limiting   its   review   to   the\n\nstatements in the 2004 annual report.5\n\n           The plaintiffs appealed, and on October 6, 2006, the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed the superior court's decision\n\ndenying declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.              On appeal,\n\nplaintiffs had urged the court to rule on \"numerous statements by\n\nthe [school board and selectmen] upon which the trial court did not\n\nrule,\" including the 2004 Cool News newsletter, the school mailers,\n\nand the election photographs.          Epping Residents for Principled\n\nGovernment, Inc. v. Epping Sch. Bd. (Sutliffe II), No. 2005-0600,\n\nslip op. at 3 (N.H. Oct. 6, 2006) (mem.).              In accordance with\n\nlongstanding principles of New Hampshire law, the court \"decline[d]\n\nto address the [plaintiffs'] assertions concerning any alleged\n\n\n\n      5\n          Plaintiffs did not argue to the superior court that it\nshould have considered additional claims arising from the materials\nin Exhibit 1, such as the Cool News newsletter, the school mailers,\nor the events that transpired during the March 8 election, nor did\nthey at any point seek to amend their petition to encompass such\nadditional claims.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fstatement    by   the   [state   court   defendants]   other   than     those\n\nspecifically addressed by the trial court.\" Id. If the plaintiffs\n\nbelieved the superior court erred in confining its review, their\n\nrecourse under state law was to raise this argument before that\n\ncourt in a motion for reconsideration; they failed to do so,\n\nhowever, and they could not raise the issue for the first time on\n\nappeal.     Their pro se status did not relieve them of their\n\nresponsibility to comply with procedural rules. Id. at 3-4 (citing\n\nN.H. Dep't of Corr. v. Butland, 797 A.2d 860, 862 (N.H. 2002)).\n\nFinally,    the   court   upheld   the   superior   court's    ruling    that\n\nplaintiffs were not entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief on\n\nthe basis of the statements in the 2004 annual report, noting that\n\nplaintiffs conceded at oral argument that these statements were\n\nlawful.    Id. at 4.\n\nB.          The Federal Court Litigation\n\n            Two months later, on December 18, 2006, plaintiffs, now\n\nrepresented by counsel, filed this suit in federal court. The suit\n\nalleged that defendants violated plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights by \"creating fora . . . for the expression of\n\ntheir viewpoints regarding spending, while failing and refusing to\n\nallow the [plaintiffs] access to such fora in order to communicate\n\ntheir contrary viewpoints regarding spending.\" Along with Sutliffe\n\nand ERPG, who were the plaintiffs in the state court action, the\n\ncomplaint listed as a plaintiff Donald Sisson, an Epping resident\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fand ERPG member.      Along with the school board and the Board of\n\nSelectmen,    the   federal   complaint   also    named   a   wider    set    of\n\ndefendants, including the Town, the Epping School District, its\n\nsuperintendent, the school district moderator, and the principal of\n\nEpping Elementary School.\n\n           The initial complaint sought only money damages and was\n\nbased on \"activities occurring in 2004 and 2005.\"              These events\n\nwere: (1) the distribution of the Cool News newsletter in February\n\nand March 2004 (which included the reference to the Advocates'\n\nwebsite); (2) the distribution of other \"promotional flyers\" by the\n\nschool in 2004 and 2005, which were mailed at the taxpayers'\n\nexpense; (3) the use of similar \"advocacy mailers\" since 2001; (4)\n\nthe placing of favorable information about a proposed school\n\naddition at the polls during the March 8, 2005, election; (5)\n\nmailings from the Board of Selectmen advocating the passage of\n\ncertain warrant articles in 2004; and (6) mailings from the Town\n\nconservation committee advocating particular political viewpoints\n\nin the 2003 and 2004 elections.\n\n           The school and Town defendants filed motions to dismiss,\n\narguing that plaintiffs' claims were barred by res judicata and the\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine.      Before the district court ruled on these\n\nmotions,     plaintiffs   moved   to   amend     their    complaint.         The\n\nplaintiffs' motion to amend was granted on May 3, 2007.           The first\n\namended complaint, filed the same day, differed from the initial\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fcomplaint in two ways. First, in an apparent attempt to circumvent\n\ndefendants' res judicata argument, the amended complaint added\n\nthree plaintiffs, Leo Grimard, Nancy Grimard, and Renee Victoria,\n\nall Epping residents who had no affiliation with ERPG. Second, the\n\nfirst amended complaint added an allegation based on alleged\n\nadvocacy in the 2006 annual report, which the plaintiffs explained\n\nis \"a matter that [they] could not possibly have raised\" in the\n\n2005 state court trial.\n\n            Defendants moved again to dismiss, and on October 12,\n\n2007, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint.            The second\n\namended complaint added a new set of allegations based on the\n\nTown's decision in 2007 to add a link on its website to the website\n\nfor the Speak Up, Epping! (SUE) event while refusing to add a link\n\nto ERPG's website.      The facts surrounding these allegations are\n\nbriefly summarized.\n\n            Since the 1990s, the Town has owned and maintained a\n\nwebsite; the Board of Selectmen determines what materials are\n\nplaced on it.      The website provides information on various Town\n\nboards   and    commissions,   Town   meetings,   and   proposed   warrant\n\narticles.\n\n            The Town website has also included hyperlinks to other\n\nwebsites.      It is undisputed that these hyperlinks have only been\n\nadded with the approval of the Board of Selectmen.        Over the years,\n\nthe Board of Selectmen has granted approval for external links to\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fthe   websites   of   \"governmental        agencies     and   certain   civic\n\norganizations,\" such as the New Hampshire Municipal Association,\n\nthe Epping Middle High School, and the Exeter Area Chamber of\n\nCommerce.     These   links   are   not     the    subject    of   plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint.\n\n            For many years, there was an informal and unwritten\n\npolicy as to when links would be added.           Defendants say the purpose\n\nof the hyperlinks on the Town's website was always to \"provide\n\ninformation to the citizenry of the Town on Town business.\"               The\n\nonly links that were permitted were ones that \"would promote\n\nproviding information about the Town,\" and any links that were\n\n\"political or advocate[d] for certain candidates\" were not allowed.\n\nHowever, on March 31, 2008, after the events at issue in this suit\n\noccurred, the Town adopted a written website policy that limited\n\nhyperlinks on the Town website to those for governmental agencies\n\nor \"events and programs that are coordinated and/or sponsored by\n\nthe Town of Epping.\"\n\n            In early 2007, the Town placed a hyperlink on its website\n\nto the website for SUE, which was an event that was scheduled to\n\ntake place on April 14 of that year.              SUE, which was part of a\n\nstate-wide program facilitated by the University of New Hampshire\n\nCooperative Extension, consisted of a day-long discussion, held at\n\nthe Epping Middle-High School, among Town residents; the event was\n\nintended to foster community spirit, civic discourse, and the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\forganization of community-defined projects and action groups.                  SUE\n\nwas not itself a formal organization.\n\n              Epping's Board of Selectmen endorsed the SUE event.              In\n\nAugust 2006, at the behest of a group of Epping residents who had\n\nformed a steering committee for SUE, the selectmen agreed to\n\nprovide      $500   in   funds    to   the    University   of    New    Hampshire\n\nCooperative Extension to cover the costs of facilitating the event.\n\nThe Board of Selectmen entered into a memorandum of understanding\n\nwith the Extension regarding the details of the event and later\n\nreceived reports from the steering committee as planning and\n\npreparation for the event progressed.                The steering committee\n\nprovided the selectmen detailed information on its members, meeting\n\ntimes, purpose, and finances. One of the reports from the steering\n\ncommittee to the selectmen also explained plans for getting the\n\nword out about the event to the Town's residents; it proposed using\n\nthe   Town    website    \"for    general     outreach\"   and   stated   that   the\n\nsteering committee would communicate with the Town administrator\n\nabout this.      Because of the Board of Selectmen's endorsement, the\n\nTown administrator allowed the link from the Town's website to the\n\nSUE event website.\n\n              On July 20, 2007, after the hyperlink to the SUE website\n\nwas added to the Town website, Sutliffe wrote a letter to the\n\nselectmen requesting that a hyperlink to ERPG's website also be\n\nadded to the Town website.          The selectmen responded with a letter\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fon August 14, 2007.     The letter stated that the Board of Selectmen\n\nneeded more information about ERPG before it could decide on\n\nSutfliffe's   request.          It   requested       that       Sutliffe    provide\n\ninformation   about    ERPG's    mission,      a   list   of    its     members   and\n\nofficers, and financial statements.                 It also inquired whether\n\nERPG's meetings and membership were open to the public, when\n\nmeetings are scheduled, how one joins the group, and how the\n\norganization spends the funds it raises.              The request essentially\n\nparalleled the information that had been voluntarily provided to\n\nthe Board of Selectmen by the SUE steering committee.\n\n          On August 21, 2007, Sutliffe responded by requesting: (1)\n\nthat the Town explain under what authority it could require such\n\ninformation from ERPG and (2) that it produce evidence that the\n\nBoard of Selectmen had requested similar evidence from SUE.                   After\n\nthe Town failed to respond, plaintiffs amended their complaint to\n\nadd two claims based on these events.\n\n          First,      plaintiffs     alleged       that   the    Town    defendants\n\nviolated their free association rights under the First Amendment by\n\nrequesting that Sutliffe disclose certain information about ERPG.\n\nThe Town claimed this information was necessary in order to allow\n\nthe Board of Selectmen to decide whether it was appropriate to add\n\nthe ERPG hyperlink. According to plaintiffs, however, this request\n\nwas intended merely to harass and intimidate, in violation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fFirst   Amendment.       See   generally    Gibson     v.   Fla.   Legislative\n\nInvestigation Comm., 372 U.S. 539, 544 (1963).\n\n            Plaintiffs' second claim was that the Town defendants\n\nviolated their Free Speech Clause rights by refusing their request\n\nto add a link to ERPG's website while simultaneously posting a link\n\nto the website of SUE.      Plaintiffs argued that the Town turned its\n\nwebsite into a designated public forum, and its rejection of ERPG's\n\nrequest could not withstand strict scrutiny.            They argued, in the\n\nalternative, that the Town engaged in viewpoint discrimination by\n\nadding the hyperlink to the SUE website and not to ERPG's and that\n\nsuch viewpoint discrimination would be impermissible even in a\n\nnonpublic forum.         Plaintiffs characterized SUE as a \"private\n\ngroup[] whose views the Town favors,\" although they provided no\n\nsupport for this characterization or any explanation of what views,\n\nif any, SUE espoused.\n\n            Defendants again moved to dismiss, and on March 25, 2008,\n\nthe district court held a hearing on these motions.                On April 4,\n\n2008, the court issued an order granting the motions to dismiss as\n\nto all the claims of the three plaintiffs added in the second\n\namended complaint and as to the bulk of the claims of the remaining\n\nplaintiffs.    Sutliffe III, 2008 WL 939183, at *14.                 The court\n\nconcluded   that   the    Grimards   and    Victoria    lacked     Article   III\n\nstanding because they failed to allege any actual or threatened\n\ninjury.   Id. at *6-7.\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f               As to the other plaintiffs, the court concluded, first,\n\nthat the claim added in the first amended complaint regarding the\n\n2006 annual report was barred by collateral estoppel.                 It reasoned\n\nthat the state court had decided the propriety of the 2004 annual\n\nreport, and it found that \"[t]here is no reason to believe, even\n\nwhen the allegations of the second amended complaint are taken as\n\ntrue    and     augmented      with   all    reasonable      inferences    in    the\n\nplaintiffs' favor, that the 2006 annual report can be distinguished\n\nfrom the 2004 annual report in any meaningful sense.\"                   Id. at *13.\n\n               Second,   the    court   concluded    that    all    the   remaining\n\nclaims,    except     those     added   in   the    second    amended     complaint\n\npertaining to the Town website, were barred by res judicata.                     It\n\nfound that the federal case arose from the same cause of action as\n\nthe earlier state court case, and that the state court case\n\nconcluded with a final judgment on the merits.               Id. at *8-10.      Once\n\nthe    three    plaintiffs      who   lacked   standing      were   removed     from\n\nconsideration, moreover, the federal complaint and the state court\n\nsuit involved the same parties or their privies.               Id. at *6-8.     All\n\nthe remaining claims brought in the federal complaint, except for\n\nthe website claim, were either brought or could have been brought\n\nin the state court suit; the claims were thus barred.                   Id. at *11.\n\n               On August 21, 2008, the Town defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment on the remaining claims, which pertained to the website.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fNovember 13, 2008.   Sutliffe IV, 2008 WL 4922348, at *12.    First,\n\nthe district court rejected plaintiffs' free association claim.\n\nThe court found there was no evidence that the Town's disclosure\n\nrequest would have resulted in \"harassment of current members, a\n\ndecline in new members, or other chilling of associational rights.\"\n\nId. at *4 (quoting United States v. Comley, 890 F.2d 539, 544 (1st\n\nCir. 1989)) (internal quotation mark omitted).\n\n           Second, the district court rejected plaintiffs' claim\n\nunder the Free Speech Clause.      The court rejected plaintiffs'\n\nargument that the Town turned its website into a designated public\n\nforum by adding the SUE link while rejecting the ERPG link.   Id. at\n\n*5-8.   Viewing the Town website as a nonpublic forum, it concluded\n\nthat the Town's actions were reasonable and there was no evidence\n\nof viewpoint discrimination.   Id. at *8-11.\n\n                                II.\n\n           We review de novo the district court's grant of a motion\n\nto dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), accepting as true all\n\nwell-pleaded facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable\n\ninferences in the plaintiffs' favor.     Gargano v. Liberty Int'l\n\nUnderwriters, Inc., No. 08-2287, ___ F.3d ___, 2009 WL 2020408, at\n\n*2 (1st Cir.

Gonázlez-Toro, 520 F.3d 58, 65 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            Plaintiffs      raise   three    arguments      on    appeal.       They\n\nchallenge the district court's ruling, in its April 4, 2008, order,\n\ndismissing for lack of standing the claims of the Grimards and\n\nVictoria,     the   three    plaintiffs      added    in    the   first     amended\n\ncomplaint. They also challenge the district court's ruling, in the\n\nsame order, dismissing the bulk of the remaining plaintiffs' claims\n\nunder the doctrine of res judicata.            Finally, they challenge the\n\nNovember 13, 2008, grant of summary judgment to the defendants on\n\nplaintiffs'    Free   Speech    Clause      claim    pertaining     to    the   Town\n\nwebsite.\n\n            Plaintiffs do not challenge the court's dismissal on\n\ncollateral estoppel grounds of their claim relating to the 2006\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fannual report.       Nor do they challenge the court's ruling on their\n\nfree association claim.\n\nA.           Dismissal of the Added Plaintiffs' Claims for Lack of\n             Standing\n\n             The doctrine of constitutional standing \"reflect[s] th[e]\n\nfundamental      limitation\"       of    judicial       power   to   \"Cases\"    and\n\n\"Controversies,\" under Article III of the Constitution.

The\n\n\"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three\n\nelements\": (1) that the plaintiff suffered an \"injury in fact,\" (2)\n\nthat there is a \"causal connection between the injury and the\n\nconduct complained of,\" and (3) that it is \"likely\" that the injury\n\nwill be redressed by the requested relief.

United for\n\nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982).                  \"The\n\nburden of stating facts sufficient to support standing rests with\n\nthe party seeking to assert federal jurisdiction.\" Sea Shore Corp.\n\nv.

(quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149,\n\n                                         -21-\n\f155 (1990)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                   Thus, plaintiffs\n\nmust \"show that [they] personally ha[ve] suffered some actual or\n\nthreatened    injury.\"       Valley    Forge,      454    U.S.    at   472   (quoting\n\nGladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99 (1979))\n\n(internal quotation mark omitted).\n\n           The district court correctly concluded that the three\n\nplaintiffs added in the second complaint could not show any actual\n\nor imminent injury. As to actual injury, plaintiffs argue, as they\n\ndid before the district court, that defendants \"have denied them\n\naccess to taxpayer-financed fora for purposes of expressing views\n\ncontrary to those of the defendants.\"               But the complaint alleges\n\nonly that Sutliffe and ERPG were denied access to these fora; it\n\ndoes not allege that the Grimards or Victoria were in any way\n\ninvolved in the other plaintiffs' stymied efforts to access the\n\n\"fora\" -- to the contrary, it explicitly states that each of the\n\nthree added plaintiffs had \"no affiliation with [ERPG].\"                     Nor does\n\nthe   complaint    allege    that    the   Grimards       or   Victoria      made   any\n\nindependent     attempts     to     gain   access        to    these   channels      of\n\ncommunication.         As   such,    there    is    no    basis    whatsoever       for\n\nplaintiffs' claim that the Grimards or Victoria suffered actual\n\ninjury.   See Pagán v. Claderón, 448 F.3d 16, 35 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           As     to   imminent     injury,   plaintiffs'         claim   fails     for\n\nsimilar reasons.       Plaintiffs argue that the Grimards and Victoria\n\nmeet the \"injury in fact\" requirement because, \"just like the other\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fplaintiffs, [they] wish to participate in the taxpayer financed\n\nfora       for   the   expression    of   views   that   the    School   and   Town\n\ndefendants have opened.\"            But the complaint is devoid of any such\n\nallegation, as the plaintiffs conceded before the district court at\n\noral argument.           And even if plaintiffs had alleged that the\n\nGrimards and Victoria \"wished to participate\" in these fora, this\n\nwould not be sufficient.            Such nebulous \"'some day' intentions --\n\nwithout any description of concrete plans, or indeed even any\n\nspecification of when the some day will be -- do not support a\n\nfinding of . . . 'actual or imminent' injury.\"                 Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n\n564; accord Summers, 129 S. Ct. at 1151; see also Port Washington\n\nTeachers' Ass'n v. Bd. of Educ., 478 F.3d 494, 500 (2d Cir. 2007).6\n\nB.               Dismissal of Plaintiffs' Claims on Res Judicata Grounds\n\n                 The district court's dismissal of all the remaining\n\nplaintiffs' claims besides those pertaining to the Town website and\n\nthe 2006 annual report was correct.\n\n                 \"Under federal law, 'a federal court must give to a\n\nstate-court judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given\n\n\n       6\n          Plaintiffs' reliance on Osediacz v. City of Cranston, 414\nF.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2005), is misplaced. Osediacz recognized that\n\"prudential standing concerns are relaxed in certain facial\nchallenges implicating the First Amendment.\" Id. at 141 (emphasis\nadded).    But plaintiffs have not raised any sort of facial\nchallenge. More importantly, we explicitly recognized in Osediacz\nthat even in the particular context of such challenges, \"a litigant\nstill must demonstrate that she satisfies the constitutional minima\nessential to establish standing.\" Id. (emphasis added); see also\nIMS Health Inc. v. Ayotte, 550 F.3d 42, 49-50 & n.5 (1st Cir.\n2008).\n\n                                          -23-\n\fthat judgment under the law of the state in which the judgment was\n\nentered.'\"   Torromeo v. Town of Fremont, 438 F.3d 113, 115-16 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (quoting Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ.,\n\n465 U.S. 75, 81 (1984)).        Thus, we look to New Hampshire law to\n\ndetermine whether the plaintiffs' earlier state court suit bars\n\ntheir claims in the present federal suit.        Id.   Under New Hampshire\n\nlaw, res judicata \"precludes the litigation in a later case of\n\nmatters   actually   decided,    and   matters   that   could   have   been\n\nlitigated, in an earlier action\" when the following three elements\n\nare met: \"(1) the parties must be the same or in privity with one\n\nanother; (2) the same cause of action must be before the court in\n\nboth instances; and (3) a final judgment on the merits must have\n\nbeen rendered in the first action.\"        Meier v. Town of Littleton,\n\n910 A.2d 1243, 1245 (N.H. 2006); accord Torromeo, 438 F.3d at 116.\n\n           As to the first requirement, the federal suit involves\n\nfour plaintiffs who were not parties to the state court suit:\n\nSisson, the Grimards, and Victoria.       It also involves a number of\n\nadditional defendants.    Plaintiffs do not contest Sisson, who was\n\na member of ERPG at all relevant times, was in privity with the\n\nstate court plaintiffs, Sutliffe and ERPG; nor did they contest\n\nthis point before the district court.       Nor do they argue that the\n\nadditional defendants cannot assert res judicata. Plaintiffs' only\n\nargument is that the requirement is not met because the Grimards\n\nand Victoria were neither parties nor in privity with parties to\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fthe state court suit.        Because we find that the district court\n\nproperly   dismissed    these   three   added   plaintiffs    for    lack    of\n\nstanding, plaintiffs' argument necessarily fails.\n\n           As to the second requirement, plaintiffs argue that the\n\nstate court suit did not involve the same cause of action as the\n\nfederal    suit   because    the   federal    suit     encompassed   factual\n\nallegations that were not present in the state suit.           We disagree.\n\n           \"New Hampshire law considers two causes of action to be\n\nthe same for purposes of res judicata when they arise from the same\n\nfactual transaction.\"       Patterson v. Patterson, 306 F.3d 1156, 1159\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (citing ERG, Inc. v. Barnes, 624 A.2d 555, 558\n\n(N.H. 1993)).      The term \"transaction\" has not been precisely\n\ndefined, see Patterson, 306 F.3d at 1159, 1160 n.1, but the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court has stated that \"'[c]ause of action' has a\n\nbroad transaction definition in the res judicata context,\" Brzica\n\nv. Trs. of Dartmouth Coll., 791 A.2d 990, 1000 (N.H. 2002).                 The\n\nfact   that   a   second    suit   contains     some    additional   factual\n\nallegations does not mean it does not arise from the same factual\n\ntransaction. Two claims arise from the same transaction so long as\n\n\"[n]o material fact is alleged in action No. 1 that was not alleged\n\nin action No. 2.\"      Patterson, 306 F.3d at 1159-60 (alteration in\n\noriginal) (emphasis added) (quoting E.

(\"Among the\n\nfactors relevant to a determination whether the facts are so woven\n\ntogether as to constitute a single claim are their relatedness in\n\ntime, space, origin, or motivation, and whether, taken together,\n\nthey form a convenient unit for trial purposes.\")                   Moreover,\n\n\"[w]hen a defendant is accused of . . . acts which though occurring\n\nover a period of time were substantially of the same sort and\n\nsimilarly motivated, fairness to the defendant as well as the\n\npublic convenience may require that they be dealt with in the same\n\naction,\"    and   the    events   are    said   to    \"constitute      but   one\n\ntransaction.\"     Id. cmt. d.\n\n            Here, it is clear that plaintiffs' claims, with the\n\nexception   of    the   website   and   the   2006   annual   report    claims,\n\nconstituted the same factual transaction as the claims brought\n\nbefore the state court.      Plaintiffs claim is essentially that Town\n\nand school officials violated their First Amendment rights \"by\n\n\n     7\n          The New Hampshire Supreme Court has repeatedly looked to\nthis section of the Restatement when defining res judicata.\nPatterson, 306 F.3d at 1160.\n\n                                    -26-\n\fopening   fora   for    the   expression    of   views    on   spending\"   while\n\n\"refus[ing] to allow the plaintiffs to express their contrary views\n\nregarding spending through such taxpayer-financed fora.\"               This is\n\nprecisely the same claim that the plaintiffs presented to the state\n\ncourt in 2005.    The fact that plaintiffs' federal complaint is not\n\nbased on the 2004 annual report but on allegations of a series of\n\nclosely related events which occurred between 2003 and 2005 does\n\nnot defeat res judicata.        These allegations are largely identical\n\nto the evidence in Exhibit 1, which the plaintiffs presented to the\n\nstate   court,   in    conjunction   with    the   2004    annual   report,   as\n\nillustrative of how they were \"denied [access] from all angles,\n\nfrom the selectmen, from the school committee, [and] from any other\n\nplanning board or conservation commission.\" To the extent that the\n\nplaintiffs now present further examples of their basic claim that\n\nthey did not present to the state court, these added facts are\n\nsubstantially of the same sort and similarly motivated and are\n\nclosely tied in time, space, and origin.                 Thus, the two cases\n\ninvolve the same cause of action.           See Brzica, 791 A.2d at 999-\n\n1000; see also Fiumara v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Cos., 746 F.2d 87, 91\n\n(1st Cir. 1984) (applying New Hampshire res judicata law); cf. In\n\nre Appeal of Univ. Sys. of N.H. Bd. of Trs., 795 A.2d 840, 843-44\n\n(N.H. 2002).\n\n           As to the third requirement, plaintiffs argue that the\n\nstate court litigation did not result in a final judgment on the\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fmerits because the state court limited its review to the statements\n\nin the 2004 annual report.            Thus, they argue, there was no final\n\njudgment on plaintiffs' numerous other allegations, such as those\n\nrelating to the Cool News newsletter, other mailers, and the events\n\nthat occurred at the March 8, 2005, election. Plaintiffs' argument\n\nconfuses the requirements of res judicata with those of collateral\n\nestoppel, as the district court properly noted.                    Res judicata does\n\nnot require a final judgment on the merits as to every specific\n\nclaim   to    be    barred;    rather,     so    long   as   the    previous      action\n\nconcluded with a final judgment on the merits, res judicata extends\n\nto \"bar[] the relitigation of any issue that was, or might have\n\nbeen,   raised      in    respect    to   the    subject     matter    of   the   prior\n\nlitigation.\"        Grossman v. Murray, 681 A.2d 90, 93-94 (N.H. 1996)\n\n(emphasis in original) (quoting Dennis v. R.I. Hosp. Trust Nat'l\n\nBank, 744 F.2d 893, 898 (1st Cir. 1984), abrogated on other grounds\n\nby Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225 (1991)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n              All of plaintiffs' claims, excluding those pertaining to\n\nthe Town website and the 2006 annual report, could have easily been\n\nbrought      as    part   of   the   state   court      action.       Almost   all    of\n\nplaintiffs' allegations in this suit are based on evidence that\n\nactually was presented to the state court.                   Seven of the exhibits\n\nattached to plaintiffs' federal complaint were included in the\n\npacket of materials presented to the state court that was labeled\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\fExhibit 1.    These include the Cool News newsletters from February\n\nand March 2004, the photographs from the March 8, 2005, election,\n\nthe March 2004 and March 2005 school mailers, and the school\n\npostage statements.     Yet another exhibit, Sutliffe's January 31,\n\n2005, letter, was attached to the original state court petition.\n\n            Plaintiffs argue that they could not have raised their\n\nclaim regarding the events that took place during the March 8,\n\n2005, election because these events occurred after the original\n\nstate court petition was filed.           But plaintiffs were able to\n\npresent these events to the state court as evidence, and nothing\n\nprevented them from amending their petition to encompass this\n\nallegation -- or any of the other allegations presented in this\n\ncase.     See Fiumara, 746 F.2d at 92 (\"[A]ll of the events which\n\ndefine the federal complaint occurred in the period before the\n\nstate trial and were at least generally hinted at during that\n\ntrial.    If they were not then litigated as hotly as the plaintiff\n\nwould now wish, they plainly could have been.\"); see also Brzica,\n\n791 A.2d at 999-1000.\n\n            Thus, the district court did not err in its res judicata\n\nruling.\n\n            We add a final note.    Res judicata is not merely a legal\n\ntechnicality.     Rather,   the    doctrine   is   rooted   in   essential\n\nconsiderations of fairness and judicial economy.            See E. Marine\n\nConstr., 525 A.2d at 711.     As the Supreme Court has stated, res\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fjudicata serves the \"dual purpose of protecting litigants from the\n\nburden of relitigating an identical issue with the same party or\n\nhis privy and of promoting judicial economy by preventing needless\n\nlitigation.\"   Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 326\n\n(1979).   Significant resources have already been spent litigating\n\nthis claim before the state court -- by both the taxpayers whose\n\ntaxes support the New Hampshire courts and by the defendants who\n\nwere brought into court (and who, incidently, are also taxpayer-\n\nsupported in this case).    It would be not only unfair but also\n\nwasteful for plaintiffs to be allowed to take another shot at these\n\nsame claims, this time in the federal system.\n\nC.        Grant of Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs' Town Website\n          Free Speech Clause Claim\n\n          We turn now to the district court's November 13, 2008,\n\ngrant of summary judgment to the defendants on plaintiffs' claim\n\nthat the Town's refusal to add a hyperlink to ERPG's website from\n\nthe official Town website violated plaintiffs' First Amendment Free\n\nSpeech Clause rights.   We affirm the district court's decision but\n\non different grounds: plaintiffs' claim fails because the Town\n\ndefendants' actions, in setting up and controlling a town website\n\nand choosing not to allow the hyperlinks, constituted government\n\nspeech.\n\n          The government speech doctrine, as applied in the recent\n\ncase of Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 129 S. Ct. 1125 (2009),\n\ncontrols our analysis. In Summum, the Court held that while \"[t]he\n\n                                -30-\n\fFree Speech Clause restricts government regulation of private\n\nspeech[,] it does not regulate government speech.\"     Id. at 1131.\n\n\"[T]he Government's own speech . . . is exempt from First Amendment\n\nscrutiny.\"     Id. (alteration and omission in original) (quoting\n\nJohanns, 544 U.S. at 553) (internal quotation marks omitted);\n\naccord, e.g., Page v. Lexington County Sch. Dist. One, 531 F.3d\n\n275, 280 (4th Cir. 2008); People for the Ethical Treatment of\n\nAnimals, Inc. v. Gittens, 414 F.3d 23, 28 (D.C. Cir. 2005); see\n\nalso 5 R.D. Rotunda & J.E. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law\n\n§ 20.11(d) (4th ed. 2008).     \"A government entity has a right to\n\n'speak for itself.'\"    Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1131 (quoting Bd. of\n\nRegents of the Univ. of Wis. Sys. v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 229\n\n(2000)).     In so doing, \"[i]t is entitled to say what it wishes,\"\n\nid. (quoting Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va.,\n\n515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\n\n\"to select the views that it wants to express,\" id. (citing Rust v.\n\nSullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194 (1991)).\n\n           Furthermore, the Court in Summum held that the government\n\nspeech doctrine may apply even when the government uses other\n\nparties to express its message.   \"A government entity may exercise\n\n[the] same freedom to express its views [even] when it receives\n\nassistance from private sources for the purposes of delivering a\n\ngovernment-controlled message.\" Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1131; accord\n\nJohanns, 544 U.S. at 562; Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 833; see also\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fRust, 500 U.S. at 196-200.      \"[W]here the government controls the\n\nmessage, 'it is not precluded from relying on the government-speech\n\ndoctrine merely because it solicits assistance from nongovernmental\n\nsources.'\"    Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1131 (quoting Johanns, 544 U.S.\n\nat 562).\n\n            More specifically, Summum makes it clear that when the\n\ngovernment uses its discretion to select between the speech of\n\nthird parties for presentation through communication channels owned\n\nby the government and used for government speech, this in itself\n\nmay   constitute   an   expressive    act   by   the   government   that    is\n\nindependent of the message of the third-party speech.           In Summum,\n\nthe Court concluded that by accepting a privately donated monument\n\nfor placement in a city park, while exercising its discretion and\n\nrejecting other proposed monuments, a city engaged in its own\n\nexpressive conduct.     Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1133-36.         By choosing\n\nwhich monuments to place in the public park, the city conveyed an\n\nimportant government message about the identity of the city.               Id.\n\nat 1133-34.   This message, the Court reasoned, did not necessarily\n\nhave to \"coincide with the thinking of the monument's donor or\n\ncreator.\"     Id. at 1136.     The city effectively controlled its\n\nmessage because it exercised \"final approval authority\" over the\n\nselection of the monuments. Id. at 1134 (quoting Johanns, 544 U.S.\n\nat 561).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\f             Thus, even though many of the monuments in the city's\n\npark \"were not designed or built by the City and were donated in\n\ncompleted form by private entities,\" the city's actions were\n\ngovernment speech. Id.; accord United States v. Am. Library Ass'n,\n\n539 U.S. 194, 204-05 (2003) (plurality opinion) (applying the\n\ngovernment speech doctrine to \"a public library's exercise of\n\njudgment in selecting the material it provides to its patrons\");\n\nNat'l Endowment for the Arts v.

Although programming decisions often involve the\n\ncompilation       of   the    speech     of   third   parties,   the   decisions\n\nnonetheless constitute communicative acts.\");8 see also Gittens,\n\n414   F.3d   at    28-30     (applying    government    speech   doctrine   to   a\n\ngovernment entity's use of editorial discretion to select between\n\nprivately submitted public art exhibits and holding that this\n\nchoice constituted a communicative act that was independent of the\n\nmessage of any of the privately submitted exhibits).\n\n\n      8\n          There is no claim in this case that there is any statute\nrequiring New Hampshire towns and school systems to present\nopposing points of view through their channels of communication,\nakin to the FCC's fairness doctrine.      See generally Red Lion\nBroad., Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 369 (1969).\n\n                                         -33-\n\f           Similarly, in this case, the Town engaged in government\n\nspeech by establishing a town website and then selecting which\n\nhyperlinks to place on its website.        The Town created a website to\n\nconvey information about the Town to its citizens and the outside\n\nworld and, by choosing only certain hyperlinks to place on that\n\nwebsite, communicated an important message about itself.          The Town\n\ndid so even more directly than did the city in Summum, which the\n\nCourt found to have conveyed a message about itself by choosing\n\nwhich privately funded monuments to place in the city park.            See\n\nSummum, 129 S. Ct. at 1134, 1136; see also Page, 531 F.3d at 285.\n\nThis expressive activity was independent of the specific content of\n\nthe websites that were hyperlinked from the Town's website.          Also\n\nlike the city in Summum, the Town defendants effectively controlled\n\nthe   content   of   this   message   by   exercising   \"'final   approval\n\nauthority' over the[] selection\" of the hyperlinks on the website.\n\nSummum, 129 S. Ct. at 1134 (quoting Johanns, 544 U.S. at 561).          It\n\nis undisputed that hyperlinks were only added to the website with\n\nthe approval of the Board of Selectmen.\n\n           Plaintiffs' attempt to compare their website to the\n\nwebsite for SUE fails.        The hyperlink to SUE was to a state\n\nuniversity-sponsored event, which received Town approval.           Thus,\n\nthe link was from a government website to another government-\n\nsponsored website and not to a private website.             Further, the\n\nhyperlink was to a Town-sponsored, nonpartisan event.        By contrast\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\fto   the        approved    link,   plaintiffs'       website    contained    partisan\n\npolitical speech, a category to which the Town had historically\n\ndeclined         to    provide   hyperlinks         regardless    of   the   viewpoint\n\nexpressed.\n\n                 To be sure, there may be limits9 to the government speech\n\ndoctrine, as to the criteria used when the government chooses to\n\nprovide hyperlinks to particular private speech and not other\n\nprivate speech.            But this is not even arguably such a case, nor is\n\nit a case of viewpoint discrimination.                     Any claim of viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination that plaintiffs could raise would be based entirely\n\non the Town's posting of the SUE hyperlink.                      Plaintiffs have not\n\nargued, before the district court or on appeal, that their claim of\n\na violation under the Free Speech Clause is evidenced by the\n\ninclusion of any of any other external links.                          And they have\n\noffered no convincing explanation for how the decision to add a\n\nlink       to    the   website   for   SUE    supports    a   claim    for   viewpoint\n\n\n\n       9\n          There are certainly other restraints on the government in\na case such as this. Summum, 129 S. Ct. 1132. If the voters do\nnot like those in governance or their government speech, they may\nvote them out of office, see Southworth, 529 U.S. at 235, or limit\nthe conduct of those officials \"by law, regulation, or practice,\"\nSummum, 129 S. Ct. at 1132. The Establishment Clause is another\nrestraint on government speech, id., and the Equal Protection\nClause may be as well.\n          We note, furthermore, that this case presents no claim of\ncompelled funding from private actors of government speech, see\nJohanns, 544 U.S. at 557-59.      Indeed, this case presents the\nreverse situation -- an attempt to compel the government to provide\naccess to private speech on government-owned communication\nchannels.\n\n                                             -35-\n\fdiscrimination.    Contrary to plaintiffs' characterization, SUE was\n\nnot a private group with a viewpoint contrary to ERPG's; rather, it\n\nwas an event conducted as part of a statewide program of the state\n\nuniversity, which the Town had endorsed and provided financial\n\nsponsorship for.    Plaintiffs have never identified any viewpoint\n\nespoused by SUE, much less how such a purported viewpoint was\n\nfavored by the Town over ERPG's viewpoint.         We do not engage issues\n\nthat are not presented by the case.\n\n           The fact that the Town did not have a formal, written\n\npolicy in place as to which hyperlinks it would place on its\n\nwebsite until after Sutliffe made his request is irrelevant to\n\nwhether the Town's actions constitute government speech.            Indeed,\n\nin Summum, the city similarly did not adopt an express policy until\n\nafter it had rejected the plaintiff's monument. Summum, 129 S. Ct.\n\nat 1134 (\"[T]he City has now expressly set forth the criteria it\n\nwill use in making future selections.\"           (emphases added)).        Far\n\nfrom finding that this weakened the city's claim that it had\n\nengaged in government speech, the Court treated this fact as\n\nfurther evidence that the city was effectively controlling its\n\nmessage.   See id.; see also Page, 531 F.3d at 278.\n\n           Moreover, the Town did have an unwritten policy of only\n\nadding links that \"would promote providing information about the\n\nTown,\"   while   refusing   to   add   links    that   were   \"political    or\n\nadvocate[d] for certain candidates.\"           Plaintiffs argue that this\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\fpolicy is belied by actual practice, but they conceded before the\n\ndistrict court that their only support for this assertion is the\n\naddition of the SUE link.        Further, plaintiffs have never argued\n\nthat the purported lack of a clear policy is evidenced by the\n\ninclusion of any other hyperlinks on the Town website.                   And\n\nplaintiffs have never explained how adding a link to the website of\n\nSUE,    which   was   a   Town-sponsored   event   and   civic   in   nature,\n\ncontradicted this established but unwritten policy.10\n\n            Our conclusion that the Town's actions on these facts\n\nconstituted government speech is consistent with the view of at\n\nleast one other circuit.11       In a pre-Summum decision, the Fourth\n\nCircuit last year held in Page v. Lexington County School District\n\nOne that the government's choice to set up hyperlinks to the\n\nwebsites of private groups on a school district's website was\n\n\n\n       10\n          This case is not about government dictating to private\nspeakers what they must include in their presentations, see Hurley\nv. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, & Bisexual Group of Boston, 515\nU.S. 557 (1995), but the contrary: plaintiffs are trying to dictate\nto the government what it must include in its presentation.\nPlaintiffs' argument in fact raises risks to values protected by\nthe First Amendment.     They argue the Town must have explicit\ncriteria for choosing to allow links, but they no doubt would\nobject to the Town telling them no link would be allowed unless\nthey changed the content of their message.\n       11\n          We do not consider the alternate analysis in Putnam Pit,\nInc. v. City of Cookeville, 221 F.3d 834 (6th Cir. 2000), which was\ndecided before the Supreme Court clarified the government speech\ndoctrine in Johanns, American Library Association, and Summum. In\nPutnam, the court analyzed the hyperlinks placed on a city's\nwebsite in terms of forum analysis. It is not clear whether the\ngovernment speech doctrine was raised in that case.\n\n                                    -37-\n\fgovernment speech.    In Page, the school district expressed its\n\nopposition to an education bill then pending before the state\n\nassembly by adding hyperlinks on its websites to the websites of\n\ntwo private organizations that were also opposed to the bill.\n\nPage, 531 F.3d at 278.    A citizen who supported the bill brought a\n\n§ 1983 suit against the school district after the school district\n\nrejected his request that he be granted equal access to the website\n\nto express his own views.     Id. at 279.     The court rejected the\n\nFirst Amendment claim on government speech grounds.      It found that\n\nthe school district had established a message and exerted effective\n\ncontrol over it, even though third parties were involved.       Id. at\n\n283-84.   By linking to the other websites, the school district did\n\nnot incorporate the contents of those websites into its own website\n\nbut merely furthered its own message by \"provid[ing] information\n\nthat   other   websites   supporting    its   position   existed\"   and\n\n\"facilitat[ing] [the] viewing [of] those websites.\"        Id. at 284.\n\nEven though the school district could not affect the content of\n\nthese websites, it maintained the necessary control over its own\n\nmessage by \"wholly controll[ing] its own website, retaining the\n\nright and ability to exclude any link at any time.\"       Id.\n\n           Plaintiffs attempt to frame this case in terms of forum\n\nanalysis rather than government speech.       They argue, as they did\n\nbefore the district court, that the Town created a designated\n\npublic forum in its website. As we understand their argument, they\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\fclaim this designated public forum was created when the Town\n\nrefused to add the link to ERPG but agreed to add the link to SUE,\n\nwhich showed that there were no clear standards for exclusion or\n\ninclusion of third-party links on its website.                   This, they say,\n\nestablished a government intention to create a designated public\n\nforum in its website.12\n\n               Contrary to plaintiffs' framing of the issue, \"public\n\nforum principles . . . are out of place in the context of this\n\ncase.\"        Am. Library Ass'n, 539 U.S. at 205 (plurality opinion).\n\nThe Town's website is obviously not a traditional public forum.\n\nGiven that the Internet itself is a \"resource [] which did not\n\nexist        until    quite   recently,\"      the   Town's    website   \"has    not\n\n'immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and,\n\ntime out of mind, . . . been used for purposes of assembly,\n\ncommunication of thoughts between citizens, and discussing public\n\nquestions.'\"           Am.

The doctrine \"first [arose] in the\n\ncontext of streets and parks,\" and the Supreme Court has warned\n\nagainst extending it \"in a mechanical way\" to \"very different\n\ncontext[s],\" such as this one.    Forbes, 523 U.S. at 672-73.   We\n\nthink that analyzing the government's decision to place certain\n\nhyperlinks on its website in terms of a doctrine rooted in the\n\ngovernment's historic regulation of speech, by private citizens, on\n\nreal, public property would require a highly strained analogy. See\n\n\n\n     13\n          The question of the Town's intentions is not determined\nby whether its policy for access is written. See Del Gallo, 557\nF.3d at 72.\n\n                               -40-\n\fM.J. Dolan, Why Monuments Are Government Speech: The Hard Case of\n\nPleasant Grove City v. Summum, 58 Cath. U. L. Rev. 7, 42 (2008).\n\nGiven that the public forum doctrine is already strained and has\n\nbeen criticized, see, e.g., Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness,\n\n505 U.S. at 693-94 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgments);\n\nUnited States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 741-43 & n.1 (Brennan, J.,\n\ndissenting); Del Gallo, 557 F.3d at 69 n.6 (collecting sources), we\n\nquestion whether this analogy would be the appropriate one.\n\n           More specifically, the Court has cautioned that the forum\n\ndoctrine should not be extended beyond the context in which \"the\n\nopen access and viewpoint neutrality commanded by the doctrine is\n\n'compatible with the intended purpose of the property.'\"           Forbes,\n\n523 U.S. at 672-73 (quoting Perry Educ.

In\n\nthis case, the Town has created a website with the intended purpose\n\nto convey information about itself to its citizens and others, and\n\nit has added a limited number of hyperlinks to external sites,\n\napproved by the Board of Selectmen, in order to further this\n\npurpose.   The public forum doctrine could risk flooding the Town\n\nwebsite with private links, thus making it impossible for the Town\n\n                                  -41-\n\fto effectively convey its own message and defeating the very\n\npurpose of the website and the hyperlinks chosen by the Town.\n\nFaced with a rule that would force it to open its website to\n\nprivate speech to such a degree that it is unable to communicate\n\nits own message, a government entity might reasonably choose to\n\nsimply   eliminate   all     external    links    from    its    website;     thus,\n\nperversely, application of the forum doctrine in this case could\n\nlead to less, not more, speech.

The majority concludes that the\n\nTown's rejection of the plaintiffs' request to put a link to their\n\norganization on the Town's website constitutes government speech\n\nnot subject to the First Amendment.            I disagree with this holding,\n\nand have significant qualms with the consequences of the majority's\n\nextension    of   the    government     speech    doctrine       to    this    case.\n\nMoreover, because I believe that there are disputed issues of\n\nmaterial fact with respect to whether the Town intended to create\n\na public forum on its website and regarding whether the Town\n\nengaged in viewpoint discrimination, I further dissent from the\n\npanel's conclusion on these two issues.\n\nA.   Government Speech\n\n            The majority holds that the Town's website, and the\n\nTown's rejection of the plaintiffs' request to add a link to their\n\norganization on that website, constitute government speech not\n\nsubject to the First Amendment.         In support of this position, the\n\ngovernment cites the Supreme Court's recent decision in Pleasant\n\nGrove City v. Summum, 129 S. Ct. 1125 (2009).              As discussed in the\n\nmajority opinion, Summum concerned a public park that contained\n\npermanent monuments privately donated by third parties.                  Summum, a\n\n\n                                      -44-\n\freligious organization, sought to add a permanent monument to the\n\npark espousing its views,14 but the city rejected this request,\n\nclaiming inter alia that \"its practice was to limit monuments in\n\nthe Park to those that 'either (1) directly relate to the history\n\nof Pleasant Grove, or (2) were donated by groups with longstanding\n\nties to the Pleasant Grove community.'\" Id. at 1130 (citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted).     The following year the city \"passed a\n\nresolution putting this policy into writing.\"      Id.   The Supreme\n\nCourt held that \"[p]ermanent monuments displayed on public property\n\ntypically represent government speech,\" and that, as such, the\n\ncity's actions were not subject to the Free Speech Clause.    Id. at\n\n1132.\n\n             The majority relies on Summum for the proposition that\n\n\"when the government uses its discretion to select between the\n\nspeech of third parties for presentation through communication\n\nchannels owned by the government and used for government speech,\n\nthis in itself may constitute an expressive act by the government\n\nthat is independent of the message of the third-party speech.\"\n\n(Op. at 32).    Indeed, as the majority notes, the Supreme Court has\n\nupheld a number of instances of governmental discrimination of\n\nthird-party speech as part and parcel of government speech, from \"a\n\npublic library's exercise of judgment in selecting the material it\n\n\n        14\n      The proposed monument would contain the \"Seven Aphorisms of\nSUMMUM,\" which are \"[c]entral to Summum religious belief and\npractice.\" Id. at 1129-30 & n.1.\n\n                                 -45-\n\fprovides to its patrons,\" see United States v. Am. Library Ass'n,\n\n539 U.S. 194, 205 (2003), to a public broadcaster's \"selection and\n\npresentation of\" debate participants.              See Ark. Educ. Television\n\nComm'n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 673 (1998).\n\n            In the present case, the majority holds that the Town's\n\nactions    constitute        \"government       speech\"    because     the   Town\n\n\"establish[ed]\" a website \"to convey information about the Town to\n\nits citizens and the outside world, and by choosing only certain\n\nhyperlinks to place on that website, communicated an important\n\nmessage about itself.\"         (Op. at 33-34).       Moreover, the majority\n\nreasons that, as in Summum, the Town similarly did not adopt an\n\nexpress policy concerning what links it would put on its website\n\nuntil after it had rejected the plaintiffs' speech.              See 129 S. Ct.\n\nat 1134. Following Summum, the majority views the ex post adoption\n\nof a policy as \"further evidence that the city was effectively\n\ncontrolling its message.\"           (Op. at 36).   Finally, and although the\n\nplaintiffs dispute this, the majority concludes that the Town,\n\nprior to its written policy, had an \"unwritten policy of only\n\nadding links that 'would promote providing information about the\n\nTown,'    while    refusing    to    add   links   that   were   'political   or\n\nadvocate[d] for certain candidates.'\" (Id. (emphasis added)).\n\n            I     disagree    that     the     government    speech    doctrine\n\nnecessarily applies to this case.             The Court in Summum emphasized\n\nthat \"[t]here may be situations in which it is difficult to tell\n\n\n                                       -46-\n\fwhether a government entity is speaking on its own behalf or is\n\nproviding a forum for private speech.\"            129 S. Ct. at 1132.    I\n\nbelieve that this is such a case.          As I argue below, there is a\n\ndisputed issue of material fact over whether the Town's actions\n\nconstituted government speech or, as the plaintiffs contend, the\n\ndesignation of a public forum as a result of the opening up its\n\nwebsite to outside links.       There is also a disputed issue of\n\nmaterial    fact   over   whether   the    Town   engaged   in   viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n            This case also differs from Summum in two other important\n\nrespects.    Although Summum similarly involved an unwritten policy\n\nof exercising discretion, the Summum Court also relied upon the\n\nhistory of privately donated monuments to support its conclusion\n\nthat \"the general government practice with respect to donated\n\nmonuments has been one of selective receptivity.\"           Id. at 1133.\n\nThere is no such history to support the Town's practice here.           The\n\nSummum Court further noted, in response to \"the legitimate concern\n\nthat the government speech doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for\n\nfavoring certain private speakers over others based on viewpoint,\"\n\nthat formal adoption by the city of the \"message\" contained in\n\nprivately donated monuments was not necessary, since the city's\n\ntaking of ownership of the monuments \"provided a more dramatic form\n\nof adoption than the sort of formal endorsement that respondent\n\nwould demand.\"     Id. at 1134.      Unlike in Summum, there were no\n\n\n                                    -47-\n\factions taken by the Town with respect to third party links that\n\nmirrors the \"dramatic form of adoption\" that occurs when a Town\n\ntakes ownership of a privately-donated monument.               The majority\n\nclaims that the Town's acceptance of links is more direct than\n\nassuming ownership of a privately donated monument, but does not\n\nexplain why.\n\n             What is lacking in this \"recently minted\" area of the\n\nlaw, see Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1139 (Stevens, J., concurring), are\n\nany limiting principles.      The majority extends the discrimination-\n\nas-government-speech doctrine to links on a government website. At\n\nleast one case, pre-Summum, has also taken that route, although in\n\nthat case it was clear that the government was engaging in its own\n\nspeech activity.      See Page v. Lexington Cty. Sch. Dist. One, 531\n\nF.3d   275   (4th   Cir.   2008)   (holding,   among   other   things,   that\n\nselection of links on a school website constituted government\n\nspeech where the school board only added to its site third party\n\nlinks in support of the board's opposition to a pending bill).             By\n\ncontrast, in the present case the majority extends the doctrine to\n\na situation where, in my view, it was not clear that the government\n\nwas engaging in speech at the time it was acting, and only\n\njustified its actions after the fact.          The majority's position has\n\nthe potential of permitting a governmental entity to engage in\n\nviewpoint discrimination in its own governmentally-owned channels\n\nso long as the governmental entity can cast its actions as its own\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\fspeech after the fact.   What is to stop a governmental entity from\n\napplying the doctrine to a parade?       Cf. Hurley v. Irish-American\n\nGay, Lesbian, & Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 574 (1995)\n\n(holding that state public accommodations law could not mandate\n\ninclusion of groups into parade, as parade was expressive conduct,\n\nand \"like a composer, the [parade organizer] selects the expressive\n\nunits of the parade from potential participants\").       Or official\n\nevents?   See Weise v. Casper, No. 05-02355, 2008 WL 4838682 at *8\n\n(D. Colo. Nov. 6, 2008) (applying government speech doctrine to\n\ndismiss claim that plaintiffs' free speech rights were violated\n\nwhen they were prevented from attending a speech given by the\n\nPresident because the plaintiffs' truck contained a bumper sticker\n\nstating \"No More Blood for Oil\").        It is nearly impossible to\n\nconcoct examples of viewpoint discrimination on government channels\n\nthat cannot otherwise be repackaged ex post as \"government speech.\"\n\n          The majority claims that there may be limits to the\n\ndoctrine, \"as to the criteria used when the government chooses to\n\nprovide hyperlinks to particular private speech and not other\n\nprivate speech.\"   (Op. at 35).   I believe that this is one of those\n\ncases, and, as I argue below, there is sufficient evidence in this\n\ncase of viewpoint discrimination to permit the issue to go before\n\na jury.\n\n          The majority further claims that \"there are certainly\n\nother restraints on the government in a case such as this.\"      (Op.\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fat 35 n.9).   It contends in a footnote that \"[i]f the voters do not\n\nlike those in governance or their government speech, they may vote\n\nthem out of office,\" or, as suggested in Summum, \"limit the conduct\n\nof those officials 'by law, regulation, or practice.'\" (Id. at 34-\n\n35 n.9 (quoting Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1132)).15              But even this\n\nremote    avenue   for    relief   through   political   processes   becomes\n\nfurther   constrained      by   expanding    the   government's   ability   to\n\nsilence opposition by narrowing the fora in which opposing views\n\nmay be expressed.        Indeed, in permitting the government to use its\n\ngovernmentally-owned channels to silence its critics in the name of\n\n\"government speech,\" the government speech doctrine, as interpreted\n\nby the majority, puts individuals who oppose the government and its\n\nactions at a structural disadvantage. This is akin to allowing the\n\ngovernment \"to fight freestyle, while requiring the other [side] to\n\nfollow Marquis of Queensberry rules.\"          R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,\n\n505 U.S. 377, 392 (1992).16\n\n\n     15\n      The majority also points to the Establishment Clause as\nlimiting government speech, which has no application here, and to\nthe Equal Protection Clause, which the plaintiffs unsuccessfully\ninvoked here.    See Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1139 (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring) (mentioning the Establishment Clause and the Equal\nProtection Clause as other \"constitutional safeguards [that] ensure\nthat the effect of today's decision will be limited.\").\n     16\n      In my view, the better course is to adopt the test proposed\nby Justice Souter in his concurrence to Summum. Although he joined\nthe majority in that case, he further noted that:\n\n     To avoid relying on a per se rule to say when speech is\n     governmental, the best approach that occurs to me is to\n     ask whether a reasonable and fully informed observer\n\n                                     -50-\n\fB.   Public Forum\n\n           The majority further concludes that the Town's actions\n\nwith respect to its website could not be interpreted as designating\n\nthe website as a public forum.              I disagree.   The majority's\n\nconcludes that \"there is absolutely no evidence that the Town\n\n'intentionally      open[ed]     a   nontraditional   forum   for   public\n\ndiscourse.'\" (Op. at 40 (quoting Del Gallo v. Parent, 557 F.3d 58,\n\n72 (1st Cir. 2009)).17         In doing so, it rejects the plaintiffs'\n\nclaim that the Town's inclusion of a link to \"Speak Up, Epping\"\n\n(\"SUE\") at least indicated that \"there were no clear standards for\n\nexclusion or inclusion of third-party links on its website.\"         (Id.\n\nat 39); see also Ridley v. MBTA, 390 F.3d 65, 104 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n\n\n     would understand the expression to be government speech,\n     as distinct from private speech the government chooses to\n     oblige by allowing the monument to be placed on public\n     land.\n\nSummum, 129 S. Ct. at 1142 (Souter, J., concurring).        Justice\nSouter's test has the benefit of preventing ex post rationalization\nof viewpoint discrimination as government speech to avoid First\nAmendment scrutiny. Rather, the actions of the government would be\nevaluated from the perspective of a reasonable observer, and, as I\nnote below, it is an open question whether a reasonable observer\nwould construe the Town's actions as government speech, as opposed\nto the designation of a public forum or simple run-of-the-mill\nviewpoint discrimination.\n     17\n      It goes without saying that I agree with the majority's\nconclusion that the Town's website is not a traditional public\nforum. See Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505\nU.S. 672, 680 (1992) (defining a \"traditional public forum\" as one\nthat has \"'immemorially . . . time out of mind' been held in the\npublic trust and used for purposes of expressive activity\")\n(omission in original).\n\n                                     -51-\n\f(Torruella, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"Courts\n\nwill hold that the government did not create a public forum only\n\nwhen its standards for inclusion and exclusion are clear . . . .\")\n\n(citation and quotation marks omitted).         But there were, in fact,\n\nno such clear standards. As the undisputed facts demonstrated, the\n\nTown did not adopt any formal policy with respect to links on its\n\nwebsite until after the plaintiffs' sought to include its request.\n\nIn fact, at oral argument the Town could not provide a definition\n\nof what that policy was, running through various definitions.\n\n            The majority points to the Town's purported \"unwritten\n\npolicy    of   only   adding   links   that   'would   promote   providing\n\ninformation about the Town,' while refusing to add links that were\n\n'political or advocate[d] for certain candidates,'\" (Op. at 35),\n\nbut the plaintiffs vigorously disputed the existence of such a\n\npolicy, and pointed to the addition of the SUE link as evidence of\n\na willingness to add outside links without such preconditions.18\n\nWhile the majority concludes that the addition of the SUE link did\n\nnot contradict the Town's unwritten policy, I disagree.                In the\n\nabsence   of   a   written,    publicly    available   policy,   one    could\n\nreasonably infer from the Town's inclusion of the SUE link, without\n\nany public process detailing the conditions of inclusion, that it\n\n\n\n     18\n      In fact, the very name given to this event, \"Speak Up,\nEpping,\" shows that the Town sought to encourage participation in\ncivic discourse, yet the Town proceeded to exclude the plaintiffs'\nparticipation.\n\n                                    -52-\n\fwas willing to open up its website to outside links.      See Ridley,\n\n390 F.3d at 104 (Torruella, J., concurring in part and dissenting\n\nin part) (\"In determining whether the government has designated\n\nproperty to be a public forum, we have previously stated that\n\n'actual practice speaks louder than words.'\" (quoting Grace Bible\n\nFellowship, Inc. v. Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 5, 941 F.2d 45, 47\n\n(1st Cir. 1991))).19    Given this reasonable inference of the Town's\n\nactions, I would have permitted the jury to address this question\n\nof intent, rather than affirm the grant of summary judgment here.\n\nSee Noonan v. Staples, 556 F.3d 20, 31 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"[W]here\n\n'motive and intent play a leading role, summary judgment should not\n\nbe granted.'\") (citation omitted).\n\n          I further disagree with the majority's conclusion that\n\n\"the public forum doctrine is not a natural fit for the issues\n\nraised in this case.\"    (Op. at 41).   I agree with the majority that\n\nforum analysis \"should not be extended beyond the context in which\n\n'the open access and viewpoint neutrality commanded by the doctrine\n\nis compatible with the intended purpose of the property.'\" (Op. at\n\n40 (quoting Forbes, 523 U.S. at 672-73).      However, the majority's\n\n\n\n\n     19\n      Although the majority notes, correctly, that the plaintiffs\nonly relied upon the inclusion of the SUE link in support of their\nclaims, at oral argument the Town admitted that it permitted the\ninclusion of links of other organizations, namely the Chamber of\nCommerce, that took \"'political'\" stances. It is unclear why we\nare required to ignore such evidence on an issue of such\nconstitutional importance.\n\n                                 -53-\n\freasoning for why it should not be extended to this context takes\n\ntoo limited view of what can be accomplished on the web.\n\n            The majority writes that converting the Town website into\n\na public forum \"could risk flooding the Town website with private\n\nlinks, thus making it impossible for the Town to effectively convey\n\nits own message, and defeating the very purpose of the website and\n\nthe hyperlinks chosen by the Town.\"         (Op. at 41).      It further\n\nargues that this flood of third party links may force the Town to\n\ntake down its website altogether.\n\n            I see no reason why this would have to be the case.\n\nUnlike a physical space, where there are limitations on the amount\n\nof speakers it can contain, the Town's website can accommodate a\n\nnear infinite number of links, save for minimal storage and server\n\ncosts.    Moreover, there is no reason why a Town cannot, consistent\n\nwith     viewpoint   neutrality,   impose   time,   manner,   and   place\n\nrestrictions which could contain the flood of private links the\n\nmajority imagines will result from opening up the Town's website to\n\nthird parties.       In fact, consistent with the government speech\n\ndoctrine, the Town could engage in preferential treatment of its\n\nown speech on the website while accommodating the speech of others.\n\nAnd although, as correctly noted by the majority, a citizen can\n\nfind another outlet on the internet to express its views, there is\n\na significant benefit to public debate in allowing a citizen to\n\nexpress his or her views in the same place as the government.         To\n\n\n                                   -54-\n\fforce a citizen to express his or her views elsewhere on the\n\ninternet would be akin to banishing a citizen from making his views\n\nknown in city hall, but instead on a street corner outside the\n\nbuilding.\n\nC.   Viewpoint Discrimination\n\n            The majority finally asserts that this is not a case of\n\nviewpoint discrimination, noting that SUE was an event which had\n\nreceived Town approval, did not have a viewpoint, and that the link\n\nto SUE was from a governmental website.   But what is important is\n\nnot the status of SUE, but whether the Town's actions in including\n\na link to SUE and then, abruptly, rejecting a similar request by\n\nthe plaintiffs can support a claim of viewpoint discrimination.\n\nThe timing of these events, combined with the lack of any clear\n\npolicy to support the Town's actions and the evident animosity\n\nbetween the plaintiffs and the Town all at least raise an inference\n\nof viewpoint discrimination sufficient in my view to at least put\n\nthe issue before the jury.20\n\n            For all of the above reasons, I respectfully concur in\n\npart and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n      20\n      I further cannot ignore the fact that, at oral argument,\ncounsel for the Town struggled to justify the Town's inclusion of\na Chamber of Commerce link on the Town's website, but not the\nplaintiffs' website.\n\n                                -55-\n\f",

This unusual First Amendment case\n\ngrows out of a dispute over access to government channels of\n\nwritten and electronic communication to conduct an ongoing debate\n\nover government spending in the Town of Epping, New Hampshire.\n\n            A citizens group that advocates reduced spending, Epping\n\nResidents   for   Principled   Government   (\"ERPG\"),   along   with   its\n\nchairman Thomas Sutliffe and another member, in 2006 brought this\n\nsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against various Town and school\n\nofficial defendants.1    The complaint was later amended in 2007 to\n\nadd as plaintiffs three other Town residents who were unaffiliated\n\nwith ERPG. Plaintiffs claimed that defendants violated their First\n\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights when defendant Town and school\n\nofficials advocated for approval of budgets and spending on school\n\nand Town purposes through school and Town newsletters, mailings,\n\nand other forms of communication including the Town website, while\n\ndenying plaintiffs access to these same communication channels to\n\nexpress their opposing views.\n\n            The district court, in 2008, dismissed the claims of the\n\nthree added plaintiffs for lack of standing.

We now affirm the rulings in both orders.\n\n                                         I.\n\n              ERPG, which describes itself as \"a perennial thorn in\n\n[the Town's] side,\" has been engaged in a longstanding effort to\n\ncurb what it sees as \"profligate spending\" by the Town and its\n\nschool district.\n\n              As part of this effort, on January 31, 2005, in the lead-\n\nup   to   the   March    8,    2005,   local       elections,   ERPG's    chairman,\n\nSutliffe, sent a letter to the Epping School Board, accusing the\n\nschool board of using public resources to engage in one-sided\n\nadvocacy in certain unspecified mailers sent prior to the previous\n\nyear's election.         The letter also cited the Epping Elementary\n\nSchool newsletter, Cool News, which it claimed gave an unfair voice\n\nto   a    private    organization      called      the   Epping   Advocates;      the\n\nnewsletter listed the address for the Advocates' website, which\n\npromoted a certain view (allegedly favorable to that of the school\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fboard) on the issues and candidates presented in the 2004 election.\n\nERPG's letter demanded that the school board afford a similar\n\nopportunity to \"those residents who hold a different point of view\n\non matters advocated by your Board\" and that all such materials\n\ndistributed in the future, particularly with regard to the March\n\n2005 election and future elections, \"include both sides of [the]\n\nissue.\"\n\n          Sutliffe had sent a similar letter on behalf of ERPG on\n\nJanuary 29, 2005, to the Town's Board of Selectmen.     The letter\n\naccused the selectmen of producing and distributing, using public\n\nfunds, a \"flyer which . . . advocated the passage of certain\n\nwarrant articles\" before the previous election. As with the school\n\nboard, the letter demanded that the Board of Selectmen provide ERPG\n\nwith an opportunity to express its opposing opinion in any future\n\nmaterials from the selectmen, specifically those relating to the\n\nupcoming March 2005 election.   Neither the school board nor the\n\nselectmen acceded to ERPG's demands.\n\nA.        The New Hampshire State Court Litigation\n\n          In response, on March 3, 2005, just days before the\n\nelection, Sutliffe and ERPG filed a pro se, ex parte petition for\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief against both boards and their\n\nrespective chairpersons (collectively the \"state court defendants\")\n\nin the Rockingham County Superior Court.    The petition sought to\n\nenjoin the school board from sending any further mailings on issues\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fpertaining to the election \"without allowance for inclusion of a\n\ndiffering viewpoint\" and to grant ERPG a \"rebuttal mailing to be\n\nsent to all Epping residents prior to the March 8, 2005 election,\n\nat the School District's expense.\"         It also requested that the\n\ncourt require the selectmen, before the March 8 election, to send\n\nan addendum to the 2004 annual report2 with ERPG's views, again at\n\nthe Town's expense.    Failing this, the petition asked the court to\n\ndelay the election.\n\n           The petition asserted that the state court defendants had\n\nviolated   the   New   Hampshire    Constitution   and   the   First   and\n\nFourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution by \"expend[ing]\n\npublic monies for purposes of promoting or advocating a particular\n\nposition on an election measure or issue.\"          In support of this\n\nclaim, ERPG's petition cited the 2004 annual report, which included\n\nsections written by both the school board and the selectmen.           ERPG\n\nclaimed that both sections contained advocacy in favor of the\n\npassage of certain warrant articles that were up for consideration\n\nin 2004.   ERPG pointed to two statements in the section prepared by\n\nthe school board's chairperson:        (1) \"We ask for your support of\n\nthe three year paraprofessional contract and the warrant article\n\ngeneral maintenance items.\"        And (2) on another warrant article,\n\n\"As always, your affirmative vote on the school budget is vitally\n\n\n     2\n          The selectmen and the school board produce an annual\nreport, which includes budget details, meeting minutes, and other\ninformation from committees, auditors, and department heads.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fimportant.    This appropriation is the money needed to effectively\n\nrun our schools on a day to day basis.\"         ERPG also objected to\n\nmaterial in the selectmen's portion, which contained a report by\n\nthe police chief on another warrant article that stated:\n\n           I am not convinced that we can accomplish the\n           mission of this department with the current\n           staffing and ask the town to support our needs\n           as we take on additional duties each year.\n           Your support is vital and I am asking you\n           again this year to vote favorably for the\n           addition to our police force.\n\n           Plaintiffs'   objections    went   beyond   the   2004   annual\n\nreport.    The petition also cited Sutliffe's January 29 and 31\n\nletters.     It alleged that, in spite of its requests, the school\n\nboard sent three mailings in the month that followed, along with\n\nnumerous flyers sent home with students, all without giving ERPG a\n\nchance to express its viewpoint.      The petition did not explicitly\n\nreference the Cool News newsletter or any other specific materials.\n\n           The superior court rejected plaintiffs' request for ex\n\nparte relief on March 3, 2005, the same day the petition was filed.\n\nRealizing that they would be unable to attain relief before the\n\nMarch 8 election, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the\n\npetition on March 4.     In place of the relief requested in the ex\n\nparte petition, the amended petition requested that the court: (1)\n\nfind that the 2003 and 2004 annual reports contained unwarranted\n\nadvocacy and thus constituted invalid expenditures of public funds;\n\n(2) enjoin \"all Epping public officials in the future from their\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fcontinued use of unwarranted advocacy,\" as required by the New\n\nHampshire and U.S. Constitutions; and (3) order that the 2005 and\n\n2006 annual reports contain a statement advising citizens on the\n\nimpermissibility of advocacy with the use of public funds.\n\n          On June 1, 2005, the superior court conducted a bench\n\ntrial on the relief requested in the amended petition.       At the\n\ntrial, the plaintiffs submitted a packet of materials labeled as\n\nExhibit 1. These materials included copies of the Cool News school\n\nnewsletter from February and March 2004; school mailers from March\n\n9, 2004, and March 8, 2005; photographs showing blueprints and a\n\nmodel of a proposed school addition which had been placed at the\n\npolls in the March 8, 2005 election; statements detailing the cost\n\nof mailing certain school flyers in 2004; and a March 1, 1996,\n\nmemorandum to the Epping School District prepared by its attorney\n\nregarding the use of public funds for advocacy.3\n\n          The superior court admitted these exhibits into evidence,\n\nbut stated that it would limit its review to the Town and school\n\nboard statements to which the plaintiffs had referred in their\n\n\n     3\n          The memorandum was prepared in response to a letter sent\nin 1996 to various school districts, including the Epping School\nDistrict, on behalf of the Granite State Taxpayers Association.\nThe Association's letter apparently asserted that it was illegal\nfor the school boards to comment on an upcoming state senate bill.\nThe memorandum, in response, recommended that school district\nrefrain from expending public funds on \"campaign material\" but\nadded that it was not impermissible for school boards to make\nrecommendations regarding warrant articles or use public funds to\neducate the public about an election issue or for elected officials\nto express their views on issues confronting their community.\n\n                               -8-\n\fpetition.4    Plaintiffs explained that the materials were intended\n\n\"to give . . . some background basically on what transpired because\n\nthis all started in the year 2004.\"       The evidence illustrated how\n\nthe plaintiffs \"were denied . . . from all angles[,] from the\n\nselectmen, the school committee, from any other planning board or\n\nconservation commission.\"     The court again clarified that it would\n\nonly \"address the denials that are contained in [the] petition,\"\n\nand the plaintiffs agreed to this limitation.\n\n             On June 15, 2005, the superior court issued a decision\n\ndenying plaintiffs' request for declaratory judgment and injunctive\n\nrelief.     It ruled that the statements in the 2004 annual report\n\n\"were made by elected public officials speaking on behalf of their\n\nrespective    public   entities\"   and   \"in   furtherance   of   a   public\n\npurpose.\"     Epping Residents for Principled Gov't, Inc. v.

Thus, the statements cited in the plaintiffs'\n\npetition did not violate the New Hampshire Constitution.          Id.    The\n\ncourt also concluded that the statements did not violate the First\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments because the \"United States Supreme Court\n\n\n     4\n          At the hearing, in response to the plaintiffs' submission\nof the materials in Exhibit 1, the court told the plaintiffs:\n     You have submitted a great deal of material. . . .

Id. at 4.\n\nB.          The Federal Court Litigation\n\n            Two months later, on December 18, 2006, plaintiffs, now\n\nrepresented by counsel, filed this suit in federal court. The suit\n\nalleged that defendants violated plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights by \"creating fora . . . for the expression of\n\ntheir viewpoints regarding spending, while failing and refusing to\n\nallow the [plaintiffs] access to such fora in order to communicate\n\ntheir contrary viewpoints regarding spending.\" Along with Sutliffe\n\nand ERPG, who were the plaintiffs in the state court action, the\n\ncomplaint listed as a plaintiff Donald Sisson, an Epping resident\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fand ERPG member.      Along with the school board and the Board of\n\nSelectmen,    the   federal   complaint   also    named   a   wider    set    of\n\ndefendants, including the Town, the Epping School District, its\n\nsuperintendent, the school district moderator, and the principal of\n\nEpping Elementary School.\n\n           The initial complaint sought only money damages and was\n\nbased on \"activities occurring in 2004 and 2005.\"              These events\n\nwere: (1) the distribution of the Cool News newsletter in February\n\nand March 2004 (which included the reference to the Advocates'\n\nwebsite); (2) the distribution of other \"promotional flyers\" by the\n\nschool in 2004 and 2005, which were mailed at the taxpayers'\n\nexpense; (3) the use of similar \"advocacy mailers\" since 2001; (4)\n\nthe placing of favorable information about a proposed school\n\naddition at the polls during the March 8, 2005, election; (5)\n\nmailings from the Board of Selectmen advocating the passage of\n\ncertain warrant articles in 2004; and (6) mailings from the Town\n\nconservation committee advocating particular political viewpoints\n\nin the 2003 and 2004 elections.\n\n           The school and Town defendants filed motions to dismiss,\n\narguing that plaintiffs' claims were barred by res judicata and the\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine.      Before the district court ruled on these\n\nmotions,     plaintiffs   moved   to   amend     their    complaint.         The\n\nplaintiffs' motion to amend was granted on May 3, 2007.           The first\n\namended complaint, filed the same day, differed from the initial\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fcomplaint in two ways. First, in an apparent attempt to circumvent\n\ndefendants' res judicata argument, the amended complaint added\n\nthree plaintiffs, Leo Grimard, Nancy Grimard, and Renee Victoria,\n\nall Epping residents who had no affiliation with ERPG. Second, the\n\nfirst amended complaint added an allegation based on alleged\n\nadvocacy in the 2006 annual report, which the plaintiffs explained\n\nis \"a matter that [they] could not possibly have raised\" in the\n\n2005 state court trial.\n\n            Defendants moved again to dismiss, and on October 12,\n\n2007, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint.            The second\n\namended complaint added a new set of allegations based on the\n\nTown's decision in 2007 to add a link on its website to the website\n\nfor the Speak Up, Epping! (SUE) event while refusing to add a link\n\nto ERPG's website.      The facts surrounding these allegations are\n\nbriefly summarized.\n\n            Since the 1990s, the Town has owned and maintained a\n\nwebsite; the Board of Selectmen determines what materials are\n\nplaced on it.      The website provides information on various Town\n\nboards   and    commissions,   Town   meetings,   and   proposed   warrant\n\narticles.\n\n            The Town website has also included hyperlinks to other\n\nwebsites.      It is undisputed that these hyperlinks have only been\n\nadded with the approval of the Board of Selectmen.        Over the years,\n\nthe Board of Selectmen has granted approval for external links to\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fthe   websites   of   \"governmental        agencies     and   certain   civic\n\norganizations,\" such as the New Hampshire Municipal Association,\n\nthe Epping Middle High School, and the Exeter Area Chamber of\n\nCommerce.     These   links   are   not     the    subject    of   plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint.\n\n            For many years, there was an informal and unwritten\n\npolicy as to when links would be added.           Defendants say the purpose\n\nof the hyperlinks on the Town's website was always to \"provide\n\ninformation to the citizenry of the Town on Town business.\"               The\n\nonly links that were permitted were ones that \"would promote\n\nproviding information about the Town,\" and any links that were\n\n\"political or advocate[d] for certain candidates\" were not allowed.\n\nHowever, on March 31, 2008, after the events at issue in this suit\n\noccurred, the Town adopted a written website policy that limited\n\nhyperlinks on the Town website to those for governmental agencies\n\nor \"events and programs that are coordinated and/or sponsored by\n\nthe Town of Epping.\"\n\n            In early 2007, the Town placed a hyperlink on its website\n\nto the website for SUE, which was an event that was scheduled to\n\ntake place on April 14 of that year.              SUE, which was part of a\n\nstate-wide program facilitated by the University of New Hampshire\n\nCooperative Extension, consisted of a day-long discussion, held at\n\nthe Epping Middle-High School, among Town residents; the event was\n\nintended to foster community spirit, civic discourse, and the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\forganization of community-defined projects and action groups.                  SUE\n\nwas not itself a formal organization.\n\n              Epping's Board of Selectmen endorsed the SUE event.              In\n\nAugust 2006, at the behest of a group of Epping residents who had\n\nformed a steering committee for SUE, the selectmen agreed to\n\nprovide      $500   in   funds    to   the    University   of    New    Hampshire\n\nCooperative Extension to cover the costs of facilitating the event.\n\nThe Board of Selectmen entered into a memorandum of understanding\n\nwith the Extension regarding the details of the event and later\n\nreceived reports from the steering committee as planning and\n\npreparation for the event progressed.                The steering committee\n\nprovided the selectmen detailed information on its members, meeting\n\ntimes, purpose, and finances. One of the reports from the steering\n\ncommittee to the selectmen also explained plans for getting the\n\nword out about the event to the Town's residents; it proposed using\n\nthe   Town    website    \"for    general     outreach\"   and   stated   that   the\n\nsteering committee would communicate with the Town administrator\n\nabout this.      Because of the Board of Selectmen's endorsement, the\n\nTown administrator allowed the link from the Town's website to the\n\nSUE event website.\n\n              On July 20, 2007, after the hyperlink to the SUE website\n\nwas added to the Town website, Sutliffe wrote a letter to the\n\nselectmen requesting that a hyperlink to ERPG's website also be\n\nadded to the Town website.          The selectmen responded with a letter\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fon August 14, 2007.     The letter stated that the Board of Selectmen\n\nneeded more information about ERPG before it could decide on\n\nSutfliffe's   request.          It   requested       that       Sutliffe    provide\n\ninformation   about    ERPG's    mission,      a   list   of    its     members   and\n\nofficers, and financial statements.                 It also inquired whether\n\nERPG's meetings and membership were open to the public, when\n\nmeetings are scheduled, how one joins the group, and how the\n\norganization spends the funds it raises.              The request essentially\n\nparalleled the information that had been voluntarily provided to\n\nthe Board of Selectmen by the SUE steering committee.\n\n          On August 21, 2007, Sutliffe responded by requesting: (1)\n\nthat the Town explain under what authority it could require such\n\ninformation from ERPG and (2) that it produce evidence that the\n\nBoard of Selectmen had requested similar evidence from SUE.                   After\n\nthe Town failed to respond, plaintiffs amended their complaint to\n\nadd two claims based on these events.\n\n          First,      plaintiffs     alleged       that   the    Town    defendants\n\nviolated their free association rights under the First Amendment by\n\nrequesting that Sutliffe disclose certain information about ERPG.\n\nThe Town claimed this information was necessary in order to allow\n\nthe Board of Selectmen to decide whether it was appropriate to add\n\nthe ERPG hyperlink. According to plaintiffs, however, this request\n\nwas intended merely to harass and intimidate, in violation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fFirst   Amendment.

Plaintiffs argued that the Town turned its\n\nwebsite into a designated public forum, and its rejection of ERPG's\n\nrequest could not withstand strict scrutiny.            They argued, in the\n\nalternative, that the Town engaged in viewpoint discrimination by\n\nadding the hyperlink to the SUE website and not to ERPG's and that\n\nsuch viewpoint discrimination would be impermissible even in a\n\nnonpublic forum.         Plaintiffs characterized SUE as a \"private\n\ngroup[] whose views the Town favors,\" although they provided no\n\nsupport for this characterization or any explanation of what views,\n\nif any, SUE espoused.\n\n            Defendants again moved to dismiss, and on March 25, 2008,\n\nthe district court held a hearing on these motions.                On April 4,\n\n2008, the court issued an order granting the motions to dismiss as\n\nto all the claims of the three plaintiffs added in the second\n\namended complaint and as to the bulk of the claims of the remaining\n\nplaintiffs.

It reasoned\n\nthat the state court had decided the propriety of the 2004 annual\n\nreport, and it found that \"[t]here is no reason to believe, even\n\nwhen the allegations of the second amended complaint are taken as\n\ntrue    and     augmented      with   all    reasonable      inferences    in    the\n\nplaintiffs' favor, that the 2006 annual report can be distinguished\n\nfrom the 2004 annual report in any meaningful sense.\"                   Id. at *13.\n\n               Second,   the    court   concluded    that    all    the   remaining\n\nclaims,    except     those     added   in   the    second    amended     complaint\n\npertaining to the Town website, were barred by res judicata.                     It\n\nfound that the federal case arose from the same cause of action as\n\nthe earlier state court case, and that the state court case\n\nconcluded with a final judgment on the merits.               Id. at *8-10.      Once\n\nthe    three    plaintiffs      who   lacked   standing      were   removed     from\n\nconsideration, moreover, the federal complaint and the state court\n\nsuit involved the same parties or their privies.               Id. at *6-8.     All\n\nthe remaining claims brought in the federal complaint, except for\n\nthe website claim, were either brought or could have been brought\n\nin the state court suit; the claims were thus barred.

It also involves a number of\n\nadditional defendants.    Plaintiffs do not contest Sisson, who was\n\na member of ERPG at all relevant times, was in privity with the\n\nstate court plaintiffs, Sutliffe and ERPG; nor did they contest\n\nthis point before the district court.       Nor do they argue that the\n\nadditional defendants cannot assert res judicata. Plaintiffs' only\n\nargument is that the requirement is not met because the Grimards\n\nand Victoria were neither parties nor in privity with parties to\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fthe state court suit.

The fact that plaintiffs' federal complaint is not\n\nbased on the 2004 annual report but on allegations of a series of\n\nclosely related events which occurred between 2003 and 2005 does\n\nnot defeat res judicata.        These allegations are largely identical\n\nto the evidence in Exhibit 1, which the plaintiffs presented to the\n\nstate   court,   in    conjunction   with    the   2004    annual   report,   as\n\nillustrative of how they were \"denied [access] from all angles,\n\nfrom the selectmen, from the school committee, [and] from any other\n\nplanning board or conservation commission.\" To the extent that the\n\nplaintiffs now present further examples of their basic claim that\n\nthey did not present to the state court, these added facts are\n\nsubstantially of the same sort and similarly motivated and are\n\nclosely tied in time, space, and origin.

Almost   all    of\n\nplaintiffs' allegations in this suit are based on evidence that\n\nactually was presented to the state court.                   Seven of the exhibits\n\nattached to plaintiffs' federal complaint were included in the\n\npacket of materials presented to the state court that was labeled\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\fExhibit 1.

Yet another exhibit, Sutliffe's January 31,\n\n2005, letter, was attached to the original state court petition.\n\n            Plaintiffs argue that they could not have raised their\n\nclaim regarding the events that took place during the March 8,\n\n2005, election because these events occurred after the original\n\nstate court petition was filed.           But plaintiffs were able to\n\npresent these events to the state court as evidence, and nothing\n\nprevented them from amending their petition to encompass this\n\nallegation -- or any of the other allegations presented in this\n\ncase.     See Fiumara, 746 F.2d at 92 (\"[A]ll of the events which\n\ndefine the federal complaint occurred in the period before the\n\nstate trial and were at least generally hinted at during that\n\ntrial.

In Summum,\n\nthe Court concluded that by accepting a privately donated monument\n\nfor placement in a city park, while exercising its discretion and\n\nrejecting other proposed monuments, a city engaged in its own\n\nexpressive conduct.     Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1133-36.         By choosing\n\nwhich monuments to place in the public park, the city conveyed an\n\nimportant government message about the identity of the city.               Id.\n\nat 1133-34.   This message, the Court reasoned, did not necessarily\n\nhave to \"coincide with the thinking of the monument's donor or\n\ncreator.\"     Id. at 1136.     The city effectively controlled its\n\nmessage because it exercised \"final approval authority\" over the\n\nselection of the monuments.

The Town created a website to\n\nconvey information about the Town to its citizens and the outside\n\nworld and, by choosing only certain hyperlinks to place on that\n\nwebsite, communicated an important message about itself.          The Town\n\ndid so even more directly than did the city in Summum, which the\n\nCourt found to have conveyed a message about itself by choosing\n\nwhich privately funded monuments to place in the city park.            See\n\nSummum, 129 S. Ct. at 1134, 1136; see also Page, 531 F.3d at 285.\n\nThis expressive activity was independent of the specific content of\n\nthe websites that were hyperlinked from the Town's website.          Also\n\nlike the city in Summum, the Town defendants effectively controlled\n\nthe   content   of   this   message   by   exercising   \"'final   approval\n\nauthority' over the[] selection\" of the hyperlinks on the website.\n\nSummum, 129 S. Ct. at 1134 (quoting Johanns, 544 U.S. at 561).          It\n\nis undisputed that hyperlinks were only added to the website with\n\nthe approval of the Board of Selectmen.\n\n           Plaintiffs' attempt to compare their website to the\n\nwebsite for SUE fails.        The hyperlink to SUE was to a state\n\nuniversity-sponsored event, which received Town approval.           Thus,\n\nthe link was from a government website to another government-\n\nsponsored website and not to a private website.             Further, the\n\nhyperlink was to a Town-sponsored, nonpartisan event.        By contrast\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\fto   the        approved    link,   plaintiffs'       website    contained    partisan\n\npolitical speech, a category to which the Town had historically\n\ndeclined         to    provide   hyperlinks         regardless    of   the   viewpoint\n\nexpressed.\n\n                 To be sure, there may be limits9 to the government speech\n\ndoctrine, as to the criteria used when the government chooses to\n\nprovide hyperlinks to particular private speech and not other\n\nprivate speech.            But this is not even arguably such a case, nor is\n\nit a case of viewpoint discrimination.                     Any claim of viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination that plaintiffs could raise would be based entirely\n\non the Town's posting of the SUE hyperlink.                      Plaintiffs have not\n\nargued, before the district court or on appeal, that their claim of\n\na violation under the Free Speech Clause is evidenced by the\n\ninclusion of any of any other external links.                          And they have\n\noffered no convincing explanation for how the decision to add a\n\nlink       to    the   website   for   SUE    supports    a   claim    for   viewpoint\n\n\n\n       9\n          There are certainly other restraints on the government in\na case such as this. Summum, 129 S. Ct. 1132. If the voters do\nnot like those in governance or their government speech, they may\nvote them out of office, see Southworth, 529 U.S. at 235, or limit\nthe conduct of those officials \"by law, regulation, or practice,\"\nSummum, 129 S. Ct. at 1132. The Establishment Clause is another\nrestraint on government speech, id., and the Equal Protection\nClause may be as well.\n          We note, furthermore, that this case presents no claim of\ncompelled funding from private actors of government speech, see\nJohanns, 544 U.S. at 557-59.      Indeed, this case presents the\nreverse situation -- an attempt to compel the government to provide\naccess to private speech on government-owned communication\nchannels.\n\n                                             -35-\n\fdiscrimination.    Contrary to plaintiffs' characterization, SUE was\n\nnot a private group with a viewpoint contrary to ERPG's; rather, it\n\nwas an event conducted as part of a statewide program of the state\n\nuniversity, which the Town had endorsed and provided financial\n\nsponsorship for.    Plaintiffs have never identified any viewpoint\n\nespoused by SUE, much less how such a purported viewpoint was\n\nfavored by the Town over ERPG's viewpoint.         We do not engage issues\n\nthat are not presented by the case.\n\n           The fact that the Town did not have a formal, written\n\npolicy in place as to which hyperlinks it would place on its\n\nwebsite until after Sutliffe made his request is irrelevant to\n\nwhether the Town's actions constitute government speech.            Indeed,\n\nin Summum, the city similarly did not adopt an express policy until\n\nafter it had rejected the plaintiff's monument. Summum, 129 S. Ct.\n\nat 1134 (\"[T]he City has now expressly set forth the criteria it\n\nwill use in making future selections.\"           (emphases added)).        Far\n\nfrom finding that this weakened the city's claim that it had\n\nengaged in government speech, the Court treated this fact as\n\nfurther evidence that the city was effectively controlling its\n\nmessage.   See id.; see also Page, 531 F.3d at 278.\n\n           Moreover, the Town did have an unwritten policy of only\n\nadding links that \"would promote providing information about the\n\nTown,\"   while   refusing   to   add   links    that   were   \"political    or\n\nadvocate[d] for certain candidates.\"           Plaintiffs argue that this\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\fpolicy is belied by actual practice, but they conceded before the\n\ndistrict court that their only support for this assertion is the\n\naddition of the SUE link.        Further, plaintiffs have never argued\n\nthat the purported lack of a clear policy is evidenced by the\n\ninclusion of any other hyperlinks on the Town website.                   And\n\nplaintiffs have never explained how adding a link to the website of\n\nSUE,    which   was   a   Town-sponsored   event   and   civic   in   nature,\n\ncontradicted this established but unwritten policy.10\n\n            Our conclusion that the Town's actions on these facts\n\nconstituted government speech is consistent with the view of at\n\nleast one other circuit.11       In a pre-Summum decision, the Fourth\n\nCircuit last year held in Page v. Lexington County School District\n\nOne that the government's choice to set up hyperlinks to the\n\nwebsites of private groups on a school district's website was\n\n\n\n       10\n          This case is not about government dictating to private\nspeakers what they must include in their presentations, see Hurley\nv.

They argue the Town must have explicit\ncriteria for choosing to allow links, but they no doubt would\nobject to the Town telling them no link would be allowed unless\nthey changed the content of their message.\n       11\n          We do not consider the alternate analysis in Putnam Pit,\nInc. v.

In Page, the school district expressed its\n\nopposition to an education bill then pending before the state\n\nassembly by adding hyperlinks on its websites to the websites of\n\ntwo private organizations that were also opposed to the bill.\n\nPage, 531 F.3d at 278.    A citizen who supported the bill brought a\n\n§ 1983 suit against the school district after the school district\n\nrejected his request that he be granted equal access to the website\n\nto express his own views.     Id. at 279.     The court rejected the\n\nFirst Amendment claim on government speech grounds.      It found that\n\nthe school district had established a message and exerted effective\n\ncontrol over it, even though third parties were involved.       Id. at\n\n283-84.   By linking to the other websites, the school district did\n\nnot incorporate the contents of those websites into its own website\n\nbut merely furthered its own message by \"provid[ing] information\n\nthat   other   websites   supporting    its   position   existed\"   and\n\n\"facilitat[ing] [the] viewing [of] those websites.\"        Id. at 284.\n\nEven though the school district could not affect the content of\n\nthese websites, it maintained the necessary control over its own\n\nmessage by \"wholly controll[ing] its own website, retaining the\n\nright and ability to exclude any link at any time.\"       Id.\n\n           Plaintiffs attempt to frame this case in terms of forum\n\nanalysis rather than government speech.

As we understand their argument, they\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\fclaim this designated public forum was created when the Town\n\nrefused to add the link to ERPG but agreed to add the link to SUE,\n\nwhich showed that there were no clear standards for exclusion or\n\ninclusion of third-party links on its website.                   This, they say,\n\nestablished a government intention to create a designated public\n\nforum in its website.12\n\n               Contrary to plaintiffs' framing of the issue, \"public\n\nforum principles . . . are out of place in the context of this\n\ncase.\"        Am.

Government Speech\n\n            The majority holds that the Town's website, and the\n\nTown's rejection of the plaintiffs' request to add a link to their\n\norganization on that website, constitute government speech not\n\nsubject to the First Amendment.         In support of this position, the\n\ngovernment cites the Supreme Court's recent decision in Pleasant\n\nGrove City v. Summum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145905\"><a href=\"/opinion/145905/pleasant-grove-city-v-summum/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As discussed in the\n\nmajority opinion, Summum concerned a public park that contained\n\npermanent monuments privately donated by third parties.                  Summum, a\n\n\n                                      -44-\n\freligious organization, sought to add a permanent monument to the\n\npark espousing its views,14 but the city rejected this request,\n\nclaiming inter alia that \"its practice was to limit monuments in\n\nthe Park to those that 'either (1) directly relate to the history\n\nof Pleasant Grove, or (2) were donated by groups with longstanding\n\nties to the Pleasant Grove community.'\" Id. at 1130 (citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted).     The following year the city \"passed a\n\nresolution putting this policy into writing.\"      Id.   The Supreme\n\nCourt held that \"[p]ermanent monuments displayed on public property\n\ntypically represent government speech,\" and that, as such, the\n\ncity's actions were not subject to the Free Speech Clause.    Id. at\n\n1132.\n\n             The majority relies on Summum for the proposition that\n\n\"when the government uses its discretion to select between the\n\nspeech of third parties for presentation through communication\n\nchannels owned by the government and used for government speech,\n\nthis in itself may constitute an expressive act by the government\n\nthat is independent of the message of the third-party speech.\"\n\n(Op. at 32).    Indeed, as the majority notes, the Supreme Court has\n\nupheld a number of instances of governmental discrimination of\n\nthird-party speech as part and parcel of government speech, from \"a\n\npublic library's exercise of judgment in selecting the material it\n\n\n        14\n      The proposed monument would contain the \"Seven Aphorisms of\nSUMMUM,\" which are \"[c]entral to Summum religious belief and\npractice.\" Id. at 1129-30 & n.1.\n\n                                 -45-\n\fprovides to its patrons,\" see United States v.

Moreover, the majority\n\nreasons that, as in Summum, the Town similarly did not adopt an\n\nexpress policy concerning what links it would put on its website\n\nuntil after it had rejected the plaintiffs' speech.              See 129 S. Ct.\n\nat 1134. Following Summum, the majority views the ex post adoption\n\nof a policy as \"further evidence that the city was effectively\n\ncontrolling its message.\"           (Op. at 36).   Finally, and although the\n\nplaintiffs dispute this, the majority concludes that the Town,\n\nprior to its written policy, had an \"unwritten policy of only\n\nadding links that 'would promote providing information about the\n\nTown,'    while    refusing    to    add   links   that   were   'political   or\n\nadvocate[d] for certain candidates.'\" (Id. (emphasis added)).\n\n            I     disagree    that     the     government    speech    doctrine\n\nnecessarily applies to this case.             The Court in Summum emphasized\n\nthat \"[t]here may be situations in which it is difficult to tell\n\n\n                                       -46-\n\fwhether a government entity is speaking on its own behalf or is\n\nproviding a forum for private speech.\"            129 S. Ct. at 1132.    I\n\nbelieve that this is such a case.          As I argue below, there is a\n\ndisputed issue of material fact over whether the Town's actions\n\nconstituted government speech or, as the plaintiffs contend, the\n\ndesignation of a public forum as a result of the opening up its\n\nwebsite to outside links.       There is also a disputed issue of\n\nmaterial    fact   over   whether   the    Town   engaged   in   viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n            This case also differs from Summum in two other important\n\nrespects.    Although Summum similarly involved an unwritten policy\n\nof exercising discretion, the Summum Court also relied upon the\n\nhistory of privately donated monuments to support its conclusion\n\nthat \"the general government practice with respect to donated\n\nmonuments has been one of selective receptivity.\"           Id. at 1133.\n\nThere is no such history to support the Town's practice here.           The\n\nSummum Court further noted, in response to \"the legitimate concern\n\nthat the government speech doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for\n\nfavoring certain private speakers over others based on viewpoint,\"\n\nthat formal adoption by the city of the \"message\" contained in\n\nprivately donated monuments was not necessary, since the city's\n\ntaking of ownership of the monuments \"provided a more dramatic form\n\nof adoption than the sort of formal endorsement that respondent\n\nwould demand.\"     Id. at 1134.      Unlike in Summum, there were no\n\n\n                                    -47-\n\factions taken by the Town with respect to third party links that\n\nmirrors the \"dramatic form of adoption\" that occurs when a Town\n\ntakes ownership of a privately-donated monument.               The majority\n\nclaims that the Town's acceptance of links is more direct than\n\nassuming ownership of a privately donated monument, but does not\n\nexplain why.\n\n             What is lacking in this \"recently minted\" area of the\n\nlaw, see Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1139 (Stevens, J., concurring), are\n\nany limiting principles.      The majority extends the discrimination-\n\nas-government-speech doctrine to links on a government website. At\n\nleast one case, pre-Summum, has also taken that route, although in\n\nthat case it was clear that the government was engaging in its own\n\nspeech activity.      See Page v. Lexington Cty. Sch. Dist. One, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1026061\"><a href=\"/opinion/1026061/page-v-lexington-county-school-dist-one/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (4th   Cir.   2008)   (holding,   among   other   things,   that\n\nselection of links on a school website constituted government\n\nspeech where the school board only added to its site third party\n\nlinks in support of the board's opposition to a pending bill).             By\n\ncontrast, in the present case the majority extends the doctrine to\n\na situation where, in my view, it was not clear that the government\n\nwas engaging in speech at the time it was acting, and only\n\njustified its actions after the fact.          The majority's position has\n\nthe potential of permitting a governmental entity to engage in\n\nviewpoint discrimination in its own governmentally-owned channels\n\nso long as the governmental entity can cast its actions as its own\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\fspeech after the fact.

It is nearly impossible to\n\nconcoct examples of viewpoint discrimination on government channels\n\nthat cannot otherwise be repackaged ex post as \"government speech.\"\n\n          The majority claims that there may be limits to the\n\ndoctrine, \"as to the criteria used when the government chooses to\n\nprovide hyperlinks to particular private speech and not other\n\nprivate speech.\"   (Op. at 35).   I believe that this is one of those\n\ncases, and, as I argue below, there is sufficient evidence in this\n\ncase of viewpoint discrimination to permit the issue to go before\n\na jury.\n\n          The majority further claims that \"there are certainly\n\nother restraints on the government in a case such as this.\"      (Op.\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fat 35 n.9).   It contends in a footnote that \"[i]f the voters do not\n\nlike those in governance or their government speech, they may vote\n\nthem out of office,\" or, as suggested in Summum, \"limit the conduct\n\nof those officials 'by law, regulation, or practice.'\" (Id. at 34-\n\n35 n.9 (quoting Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1132)).15              But even this\n\nremote    avenue   for    relief   through   political   processes   becomes\n\nfurther   constrained      by   expanding    the   government's   ability   to\n\nsilence opposition by narrowing the fora in which opposing views\n\nmay be expressed.        Indeed, in permitting the government to use its\n\ngovernmentally-owned channels to silence its critics in the name of\n\n\"government speech,\" the government speech doctrine, as interpreted\n\nby the majority, puts individuals who oppose the government and its\n\nactions at a structural disadvantage.

See Summum, 129 S. Ct. at 1139 (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring) (mentioning the Establishment Clause and the Equal\nProtection Clause as other \"constitutional safeguards [that] ensure\nthat the effect of today's decision will be limited.\").\n     16\n      In my view, the better course is to adopt the test proposed\nby Justice Souter in his concurrence to Summum. Although he joined\nthe majority in that case, he further noted that:\n\n     To avoid relying on a per se rule to say when speech is\n     governmental, the best approach that occurs to me is to\n     ask whether a reasonable and fully informed observer\n\n                                     -50-\n\fB.   Public Forum\n\n           The majority further concludes that the Town's actions\n\nwith respect to its website could not be interpreted as designating\n\nthe website as a public forum.              I disagree.   The majority's\n\nconcludes that \"there is absolutely no evidence that the Town\n\n'intentionally      open[ed]     a   nontraditional   forum   for   public\n\ndiscourse.'\" (Op. at 40 (quoting Del Gallo v.

Justice\nSouter's test has the benefit of preventing ex post rationalization\nof viewpoint discrimination as government speech to avoid First\nAmendment scrutiny. Rather, the actions of the government would be\nevaluated from the perspective of a reasonable observer, and, as I\nnote below, it is an open question whether a reasonable observer\nwould construe the Town's actions as government speech, as opposed\nto the designation of a public forum or simple run-of-the-mill\nviewpoint discrimination.\n     17\n      It goes without saying that I agree with the majority's\nconclusion that the Town's website is not a traditional public\nforum.

In the\n\nabsence   of   a   written,    publicly    available   policy,   one    could\n\nreasonably infer from the Town's inclusion of the SUE link, without\n\nany public process detailing the conditions of inclusion, that it\n\n\n\n     18\n      In fact, the very name given to this event, \"Speak Up,\nEpping,\" shows that the Town sought to encourage participation in\ncivic discourse, yet the Town proceeded to exclude the plaintiffs'\nparticipation.\n\n                                    -52-\n\fwas willing to open up its website to outside links.

It further\n\nargues that this flood of third party links may force the Town to\n\ntake down its website altogether.\n\n            I see no reason why this would have to be the case.\n\nUnlike a physical space, where there are limitations on the amount\n\nof speakers it can contain, the Town's website can accommodate a\n\nnear infinite number of links, save for minimal storage and server\n\ncosts.    Moreover, there is no reason why a Town cannot, consistent\n\nwith     viewpoint   neutrality,   impose   time,   manner,   and   place\n\nrestrictions which could contain the flood of private links the\n\nmajority imagines will result from opening up the Town's website to\n\nthird parties.       In fact, consistent with the government speech\n\ndoctrine, the Town could engage in preferential treatment of its\n\nown speech on the website while accommodating the speech of others.\n\nAnd although, as correctly noted by the majority, a citizen can\n\nfind another outlet on the internet to express its views, there is\n\na significant benefit to public debate in allowing a citizen to\n\nexpress his or her views in the same place as the government.         To\n\n\n                                   -54-\n\fforce a citizen to express his or her views elsewhere on the\n\ninternet would be akin to banishing a citizen from making his views\n\nknown in city hall, but instead on a street corner outside the\n\nbuilding.\n\nC.   Viewpoint Discrimination\n\n            The majority finally asserts that this is not a case of\n\nviewpoint discrimination, noting that SUE was an event which had\n\nreceived Town approval, did not have a viewpoint, and that the link\n\nto SUE was from a governmental website.   But what is important is\n\nnot the status of SUE, but whether the Town's actions in including\n\na link to SUE and then, abruptly, rejecting a similar request by\n\nthe plaintiffs can support a claim of viewpoint discrimination.\n\nThe timing of these events, combined with the lack of any clear\n\npolicy to support the Town's actions and the evident animosity\n\nbetween the plaintiffs and the Town all at least raise an inference\n\nof viewpoint discrimination sufficient in my view to at least put\n\nthe issue before the jury.20\n\n            For all of the above reasons, I respectfully concur in\n\npart and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n      20\n      I further cannot ignore the fact that, at oral argument,\ncounsel for the Town struggled to justify the Town's inclusion of\na Chamber of Commerce link on the Town's website, but not the\nplaintiffs' website.\n\n                                -55-\n\f</pre>",
