Blanco on brief pro se.\n                    \n   Lincoln  c.  Almond,  United  States  Attorney,  Margaret E.\n                                                               \nCurran and Kenneth P. Madden,  Assistant United States Attorneys,\n                          \non brief for appellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                         June 9, 1993\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.  The appellant, Alfonso Blanco, pleaded\n                    \n\nguilty in  1989 to  three counts  of possessing  cocaine with\n\nintent to distribute.  The government had also charged Blanco\n\nwith two counts  of attempted distribution, and  one count of\n\nconspiracy to  distribute, but  it dropped  those charges  in\n\nreturn  for  Blanco's  guilty  plea.    The  district  court,\n\nfollowing the  Sentencing Guidelines, sentenced Blanco  to 84\n\nmonths in prison.  Blanco appealed, challenging the sentence,\n\nand we affirmed.  United States v. Blanco, 888 F.2d  907 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1989).\n\n     In 1992  Blanco filed a  pro se \"Motion for  Findings of\n                                    \n\nFact  Pursuant  to  FRCP  32  and  Modification  of  Sentence\n\nPursuant  to  28  United  States Code  Section  2255.\"    The\n\ndistrict court denied  the motion, and this  appeal followed.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n     Blanco's  primary  claim  is that  his  guilty  plea was\n\n\"involuntary\" because  he received ineffective  assistance of\n\ncounsel  --  specifically,  because   his  lawyer  mistakenly\n\nassured him that, if he pleaded guilty, he would receive only\n\na  twenty-seven  month  prison  sentence.    Although  Blanco\n\ndivides his  brief into separate sections  on involuntariness\n\nand ineffective  assistance, the  Supreme Court  has made  it\n\nclear  that where  a  defendant pleads  guilty  on advice  of\n\ncounsel,  \"the voluntariness of  the plea depends  on whether\n\ncounsel's advice 'was within the range of competence demanded\n\n                             -2-\n\nof attorneys in criminal cases.'\"  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n52, 56  (1985) (quoting McMann  v. Richardson, 397  U.S. 759,\n                                             \n\n771  (1970)).      Accordingly,  we   will   treat   Blanco's\n\ninvoluntariness  and ineffective  assistance  arguments as  a\n\nunit, focusing on the adequacy of counsel's advice.\n\n     In  Hill v.  Lockhart, the  Supreme Court  also  made it\n                          \n\nclear that  the two-part  standard for  evaluating claims  of\n\nineffective  assistance   of  counsel,  first   announced  in\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), applies to the\n                        \n\nguilty-plea process.  Hill, 474 U.S.  at 57.  The court  must\n                          \n\nask: (1)  whether counsel's  advice was  within the  range of\n\ncompetence demanded of  attorneys in criminal cases,  and (2)\n\nwhether the  defendant suffered  \"prejudice.\"  Prejudice,  in\n\nthis context, means  \"a reasonable probability that,  but for\n\ncounsel's  errors, [the  defendant]  would  not have  pleaded\n\nguilty and  would have insisted on  going to trial.\"   Id. at\n                                                          \n\n59.\n\n     A  number of  courts have  held that  a lawyer  does not\n\nrender ineffective  assistance if,  while  advising a  client\n\nabout whether  to plead  guilty, the  lawyer merely  makes an\n\ninaccurate  prediction about  the  expected  sentence.   See,\n                                                             \n\ne.g., United States v. Arvanitis, 902 F.2d 489, 494 (7th Cir.\n                                \n\n1990); United  States v.  Sweeney, 878 F.2d  68, 69  (2d Cir.\n                                 \n\n1989); United States  v. Turner, 881 F.2d 684,  687 (9th Cir.\n                               \n\n1989).   Cf.  Iaea v.  Sunn,  800 F.2d  861 (9th  Cir.  1986)\n                           \n\n                             -3-\n\n(though \"mere inaccurate prediction\" would not be ineffective\n\nassistance, lawyer's \"gross mischaracterization of the likely\n\noutcome,\"  combined  with  erroneous  advice  about  possible\n\neffects  of  going  to  trial,   fell  \"below  the  level  of\n\ncompetence required of defense attorneys\").  \n\n     We  need  not  determine whether  the  lawyer's  lack of\n\nclairvoyance here fell below the level of competence required\n\nof  defense  attorneys,  because we  conclude  that  Blanco's\n\nallegations  were  insufficient  to   satisfy  the  prejudice\n\nrequirement.  Blanco never even told the district court that,\n\nbut for counsel's  mistake, he would have  pleaded not guilty\n\nand insisted on going to trial, Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. at\n                                                \n\n60,1   and he  has given  us no  reason to  believe that  the\n\nfaulty estimate of his sentence might actually have \"affected\n\nthe outcome of  the plea process\" in  that way.  Id.  at 59. \n                                                    \n\nThe trial judge told Blanco in no uncertain terms at the plea\n\nhearing  that he  would  not be  able  to determine  Blanco's\n\nsentence  until   after  the  presentence   report  had  been\n                       \n\ncompleted,  that in passing  sentence the court  would not be\n\nbound  by the prosecutor's recommendation, and that the court\n\ncould even, in appropriate circumstances, depart upwards from\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines range.   Blanco told the court that\n\nhe  understood these conditions.  He  then admitted his guilt\n\n                    \n\n1.  Blanco  made this  assertion for  the first  time in  his\nappellate brief.\n\n                             -4-\n\nunder oath (and even today does not deny it), and received  a\n\nsentence which, though  longer than his lawyer's  prediction,\n\nstill was substantially shorter than the sixty-year statutory\n\nmaximum about  which the  court had also  warned him.   These\n\nfacts vitiate any contention that Blanco relied solely on his\n\nlawyer's optimism  in deciding  whether to  plead guilty,  or\n\nthat he  would have pleaded not guilty had he received a more\n\npessimistic (and accurate) estimate from counsel.\n\n     Blanco says that  his lawyer  also rendered  ineffective\n\nassistance  by failing  to prepare  adequately  for a  trial.\n\nAccording  to Blanco, the lawyer neither conducted a pretrial\n\ninvestigation  nor filed all the \"required\" pretrial motions.\n\nA  claim of ineffective preparation requires the Section 2255\n\npetitioner to  make  \"specific  allegations  concerning  'the\n\nfacts or defenses  which counsel would have uncovered' had he\n\nbeen prepared.\"  United States v. Johnson,  624 F.Supp. 1191,\n                                         \n\n1194 (E.D.Pa.  1986) (quoting  United States  v. Thomas,  470\n                                                       \n\nF.Supp. 968, 972 (E.D.Pa. 1979)).   Blanco says only that his\n\nlawyer's inaction  \"precluded the  mounting  of an  effective\n\nentrapment  defense.\"  This allegation, however, is undone by\n\n(1) Blanco's failure to state any facts which would show that\n                                       \n\nthe lawyer could have come  up with an entrapment defense had\n\nhe  worked harder,  and  (2)  the  lawyer's  statement,  made\n\nwithout contradiction in Blanco's presence at  the sentencing\n\nhearing, that \"[a]fter reviewing the evidence, after speaking\n\n                             -5-\n\nwith Mr. Blanco  at great length .  . . we realized  that [an\n\nentrapment defense] was to no avail.\"\n\n     Finally, Blanco claims that the district  court violated\n\nFed.  R. Crim. P. 32 when it sentenced him.  Rule 32(a)(1)(A)\n\nrequires the trial court to \"determine that the defendant and\n\ndefendant's  counsel have  had the  opportunity  to read  and\n\ndiscuss  the  presentence  investigation report\"  before  the\n\ncourt imposes  sentence.  Blanco says that the district court\n\ndid not satisfy this  requirement because it never  asked him\n\n(1)  whether he  had  read  the report,  (2)  whether he  had\n\ndiscussed it  with his lawyer,  and (3) whether he  wanted to\n\nchallenge any facts in  it.  See  United States v. Rone,  743\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 1169, 1174  (7th Cir. 1984) (requiring  sentencing court\n\nto ask those three questions).\n\n     Unlike  the  Seventh  Circuit,   this  court  has  never\n\ndemanded that the district court comply with Rule 32(a)(1)(A)\n\nby   asking  such  specific   questions.    Rather,  \"binding\n\nprecedent  in  this  circuit  has  directed  that  if  it  is\n\nabundantly  clear  from  the  sentencing  hearing  that  both\n\ndefendant and his counsel are familiar with the report, a new\n\nsentencing hearing will  not be mandated,  even if the  court\n\nfailed  to  directly  inquire whether  the  defendant  had an\n\nopportunity to review the  report. . .  .\"  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nManrique, 959 F.2d  1155, 1157-58 (1st Cir. 1992).   See also\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924, 931 (1st Cir. 1987).\n                       \n\n                             -6-\n\n     According to the transcript of the sentencing hearing in\n\nthis case, the district court certainly had \"abundant\" reason\n\nto determine  that Blanco's lawyer had received  and read the\n\npresentence  investigation report.    The lawyer  stated  his\n\nobjections to the report so specifically as to leave no doubt\n\nof his familiarity with its contents.  \n\n     Although the  discussion at  the sentencing  hearing did\n\nnot reveal to the district  court whether Blanco had seen the\n                                                \n\npresentence report, we  know that  he did:  his Section  2255\n\nmotion  tells us that  \"[p]rior to sentencing  the Petitioner\n\nand  his  counsel  reviewed  the  Pre-sentence  Investigation\n\nReport prepared  by the United States Probation  Office.\"  In\n\nsimilar circumstances, this court recently found no violation\n\nof Rule  32(a)(1)(A), reasoning  that \"[a]s  the record  well\n\nestablishes that defense counsel was intimately familiar with\n\nthe [presentence  report], we  will not  assume that  defense\n\ncounsel  did not discuss  so critically important  a document\n\nwith  his  client,  especially  since  appellant  claims   no\n\ndereliction.\"   United States  v. Cruz, 981  F.2d 613, 619-20\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n     Even if the district court did violate Rule 32(a)(1)(A),\n\nits  lapse is not  corrigible in this  collateral proceeding.\n\nThe Supreme Court  has held that a trial  court's failure \"to\n\nask a  defendant represented  by an  attorney whether he  has\n\nanything to say  before sentence is imposed is  not of itself\n\n                             -7-\n\nan error  of the  character or magnitude  cognizable under  a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus.\"  Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424,\n                                              \n\n428 (1962).  See also  Padilla Palacios v. United States, 932\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 31,  36 n.8 (1st Cir. 1991).   The Supreme Court in Hill\n                                                             \n\nv.  United States was referring to  the trial court's general\n                 \n\nduty, under Rule  32(a)(1)(C), to give a pleading defendant a\n\nchance to  speak  before sentencing,  but we  think that  the\n\nprinciple  also suits  the court's  more specific  obligation\n\nunder  Rule  32(a)(1)(A).   The  failure to  ask  a defendant\n\nwhether he  has had the  opportunity to read and  discuss the\n\npresentence  investigation report, like the failure to hear a\n\ndefendant's  statement in mitigation  of his sentence,  is an\n\nerror  which  in  itself   \"is  neither  jurisdictional   nor\n\nconstitutional.    It  is  not  a  fundamental  defect  which\n\ninherently  results in a complete miscarriage of justice, nor\n\nan omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair\n\nprocedure.\"  Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. at 428.\n                                  \n\n     The Supreme Court in Hill left open the possibility that\n                              \n\nSection 2255  relief might  \"be available if  a violation  of\n\nRule  32(a)  occurred  in the  context  of  other aggravating\n\ncircumstances.\"  Id.  The underlying concern is \"that matters\n                    \n\nin mitigation  of sentence  should be  fairly presented  to a\n\nsentencing judge prior to rendition of final sentence.\"  Katz\n                                                             \n\nv. King, 627 F.2d  568, 576 (1st Cir. 1980).   Thus, in Green\n                                                             \n\nv.  United States,  313 F.2d  6, 9-10  (1st Cir.  1963), this\n                 \n\n                             -8-\n\ncourt vacated the  denial of a Section 2255  motion where the\n\npetitioner  claimed that  he  had been  denied  his right  to\n\naddress the court before sentencing, and that as a result the\n\ncourt   did  not  learn   \"of  several  matters   unknown  to\n\n[petitioner's]  counsel  which  would  have  corrected  false\n\nimpressions implanted in the mind  of the court by remarks of\n\nthe assistant district attorney.\"\n\n     Blanco cannot build  upon this rock.  He  tells us that,\n\nwhen he reviewed the  presentence report with his  lawyer, he\n\nregistered objections  to  the amount  of cocaine  reportedly\n\ninvolved, and  to the  decision not to  give him  a two-level\n\nSentencing   Guidelines   adjustment    for   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility.2   The lawyer  presented these objections  to\n\nthe  district court  (and  later, on  direct appeal,  to this\n\ncourt).  Since  the \"matters in mitigation\" were presented to\n\nthe district  court  before it  passed sentence,  we find  no\n\n\"aggravating circumstances\"  that might warrant  Section 2255\n\nrelief.\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                    \n\n2.   Blanco also says that he objected to the manner in which\nthe   presentence   report    \"inaccurately   portrayed   his\ninvolvement  in the  offense activity.\"    However, he  never\ndescribed  how  the  report was  inaccurate,  nor  stated the\n              \nfactual  objections he might  have presented to  the district\ncourt had he been given the opportunity.\n\n                             -9-\n",

Blanco told the court that\n\nhe  understood these conditions.  He  then admitted his guilt\n\n                    \n\n1.

Blanco says only that his\n\nlawyer's inaction  \"precluded the  mounting  of an  effective\n\nentrapment  defense.\"  This allegation, however, is undone by\n\n(1) Blanco's failure to state any facts which would show that\n                                       \n\nthe lawyer could have come  up with an entrapment defense had\n\nhe  worked harder,  and  (2)  the  lawyer's  statement,  made\n\nwithout contradiction in Blanco's presence at  the sentencing\n\nhearing, that \"[a]fter reviewing the evidence, after speaking\n\n                             -5-\n\nwith Mr. Blanco  at great length .  . . we realized  that [an\n\nentrapment defense] was to no avail.\"\n\n     Finally, Blanco claims that the district  court violated\n\nFed.
