United States v. Mena-Robles, 4  F.3d 1026, 1029\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir.  1993); United States  v. Hernandez, 995  F.2d 307,\n                                             \n\n311  (1st  Cir. 1993).    Defendant's  arrest and  indictment\n\nfollowed  a Drug  Enforcement Administration  (DEA) sponsored\n\nundercover operation  spanning the last five  months of 1991.\n\nFive others were also  caught in the undercover net  and were\n\nindicted along  with defendant.   Although defendant  was the\n\nsole defendant at trial, the co-conspirators' names appear in\n\nthe  record and  are  essential to  understand the  evidence:\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nOscar Gonzalez Lopez; Daniel Alberto  Atilio Adinolfi; Victor\n\nRodriguez Alvarez;  John  Doe, a/k/a  Edgardo Rodriguez;  and\n\nJorge Omar Lopez  Almeida.  As is usual in  a drug undercover\n\noperation,  many of the conversations, telephone and face-to-\n\nface, were recorded.\n\n          Defendant  was the  owner-operator of  a restaurant\n\ncalled \"Mi  Pequena Colombia\"  located on Domenech  Avenue in\n\nHato  Rey.  The  undercover operation  started on  August 21,\n\n1991, when  DEA Agent  Jefferson Moran  and  Pablo Rivera,  a\n\nmember  of the Police of Puerto Rico assigned to the DEA, met\n\nwith Oscar Gonzalez Lopez (Oscar) at a shopping center in Rio\n\nPiedras,  Puerto Rico.   DEA  Agent Moran  was introduced  to\n\nOscar by  Agent Rivera as being interested  in buying cocaine\n\nor heroin.   Oscar made a telephone call from  a public phone\n\nbooth.   He then  asked  the agents  for $250  to obtain  two\n\nsamples of heroin.  After obtaining the money, he accompanied\n\nthe  agents to  Domenech Avenue,  where he  left the  car and\n\nheaded  in  the  direction  of defendant's  restaurant.    He\n\nreturned  shortly and  gave Agent  Moran a  cigarette package\n\ncontaining two separate samples of heroin.  Between August 23\n\nand 29, Oscar and Agent Moran discussed, mostly by telephone,\n\nthe purchase of an ounce of heroin for $7,500.  On August 29,\n\nOscar and the two agents met and went together to defendant's\n\nrestaurant.  At the restaurant they were introduced to Victor\n\nRodriguez Alvarez (Victor).   Victor asked for the payment of\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n$7,500 before turning over  the heroin.  After  receiving the\n\nmoney,  he  went  into the  restaurant  and  gave  it to  the\n\nbartender, Edgar  Rodriguez Velazquez (Edgar).1   Edgar  then\n\ngave Victor  the heroin,  who  delivered it  to Agent  Moran.\n\nVictor went back  into the restaurant and  asked if defendant\n\nhad  called and  Edgar  said \"No.\"   Later,  defendant called\n\nEdgar and was  told that Victor had delivered the merchandise\n\nand he, Edgar, had the $7,500.  Sometime later defendant came\n\nto  the restaurant and  the $7,500 was turned  over to him by\n\nEdgar.\n\n          On September  13, 1991, Agent Rivera  was called by\n\nVictor and it  was agreed  that Victor would  sell Rivera  an\n\nounce of heroin for  $7,000.  Agent Rivera then  proceeded to\n\ndefendant's  restaurant and  asked  Edgar  where Victor  was.\n\nDefendant  was present when the inquiry was made.  Rivera was\n\ntold that Victor was at a  nearby pizzeria.  Rivera made  the\n\n\"buy\"  at the pizzeria.   He paid Victor  $7,000 and received\n\nfrom him an ounce  of heroin.  After the  transaction, Victor\n\nwent to defendant's restaurant and met with defendant, Edgar,\n\nand  Daniel Alberto Atilio Adinolfi (Atilio).  The $7,000 was\n\ngiven to Atilio, who passed it to Edgar, who put it under the\n\ncounter.\n\n                    \n\n1.  Named in indictment as John Doe a/k/a Edgardo Rodriguez.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          On   September   25,  1991,   Agent   Moran  called\n\ndefendant's  restaurant  and  asked  for  Victor.   Defendant\n\nanswered  the phone and after  the inquiry, put  Edgar on the\n\nline.   Moran  asked Edgar to  have Victor  call him.   Later\n\nVictor called Agent Rivera and they  set up a meeting at  the\n\npizzeria near defendant's restaurant.   Before meeting Rivera\n\nat the  pizzeria, Victor  went to defendant's  restaurant and\n\nobtained an ounce of heroin from Atilio.  Defendant and Edgar\n\nwere at the restaurant  at the time the heroin  was obtained.\n\nVictor  delivered  the heroin  to  Rivera in  return  for the\n\npayment of $7,000.   Victor returned to the  restaurant, gave\n\nthe money to  Atilio and  asked for his  commission.   Atilio\n\nrefused to give Victor a commission; instead he referred  him\n\nto defendant.  Defendant told Victor that no commission would\n\nbe paid  because Victor owed him  $200.  This was  the end of\n\nVictor's  dealings with the  undercover agents.   Presumably,\n\ndefendant  and his cohorts found out that he had been dealing\n\nwith a DEA agent.\n\n          In  late   November  or  early  December,  the  DEA\n\nrecruited a confidential informant, Eliezer Gallegos, to join\n\nits undercover operation.   On December 5,  Gallegos met with\n\ndefendant and Atilio at the restaurant where the purchase  of\n\none-half of a  kilogram of cocaine for  $5,000 was discussed.\n\nOn December  6, another negotiation  meeting was held  at the\n\nrestaurant.   At  the end  of the  conversation,  Atilio told\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nGallegos that they would  take a ride and complete  the deal.\n\nDefendant had told Atilio:   \"If he is going to buy  the car,\n\ntake him  around for a  ride so  he will get  acquainted with\n\nit.\"  Gallegos understood  this to mean that the  cocaine was\n\nin a car.   Gallegos and Atilio left the restaurant, got into\n\na car, and drove around the block.  The \"buy\" was made in the\n\ncar; Gallegos paid Atilio $5,000 and received half a kilogram\n\nof  cocaine.   During the  drive around  the block  they were\n\nfollowed  by  Jorge  Omar Lopez  Almeida,  who  was  riding a\n\nmotorcycle.  Presumably, this was to protect the \"buy.\"\n\n          Later that same day, Gallegos called the restaurant\n\nand told Edgar that the half kilo of cocaine was short by six\n\ngrams.  On December  11, Gallegos called Atilio and  told him\n\nthat the  cocaine he had bought  was six grams less  than the\n\namount  agreed upon.  Atilio promised  Gallegos that he would\n\nmake up  the shortage the next  day and sell him  a sample of\n\nheroin  for $200.  Gallegos  went to the  restaurant the next\n\nday.   Defendant  was at  a table  with two  unknown persons.\n\nAtilio  was  at another  table  with Edgar.    Gallegos asked\n\nAtilio  for the six grams  of cocaine and  the heroin sample.\n\nHe was told by Atilio to  wait because defendant was busy.  A\n\nlittle later Atilio  went over  to defendant who  gave him  a\n\npackage.    Atilio  passed  the  package  to  Gallegos.    It\n\ncontained six grams of cocaine and a heroin sample.  The next\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nday Gallegos went to  the restaurant and paid Edgar  $200 for\n\nthe heroin sample.  \n\n          It  was stipulated  that  the drugs  bought by  the\n\nundercover agents and  the confidential informant  tested out\n\nas heroin and cocaine.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  The Rule 29 Motion2\nA.  The Rule 29 Motion\n\n          Defendant argues that  the district court  erred in\n\ndenying  his   Fed.R.Crim.P.  29   motion  for  judgment   of\n\nacquittal.  In reviewing  the denial of a Rule 29  motion, we\n\nconsider  all the  evidence, draw  all reasonable  inferences\n\ntherefrom, and resolve all issues of credibility in the light\n\nmost  favorable  to the  government,  in  order to  determine\n\nwhether a jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant\n\nwas guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d at\n                                                  \n\n1031;  Hernandez, 995 F.2d at 311.  \n                \n\n          The thrust  of defendant's argument is  that he was\n\nsimply   an  honest   businessman  and   restauranteur  whose\n\nmisadventure  it  was  that  drug  dealers  operated  on  his\n\npremises without his  blessing, knowledge, or  participation.\n\nIn support of this position,  defendant points out that  none\n\nof  the myriad  DEA recordings  or photographs  introduced at\n\ntrial capture him conducting an illicit drug transaction.  We\n\nhave  reviewed the record carefully and, while we concur with\n\ndefendant's contention  that the  government did  not produce\n\n                    \n\n2.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 states, in relevant part:  \"The court on\nmotion  of defendant  or on  its own  motion shall  order the\nentry  of  judgment  of acquittal  of  one  or more  offenses\ncharged  in the indictment  or  information after evidence on\neither  side is  closed if  the  evidence is  insufficient to\nsustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\"\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nany direct evidence  of his complicity,  we must reject  both\n\nhis premise and  his conclusion, because neither has  a legal\n\nbasis.  To  the contrary, it is  a well-established principle\n\nthat,\n\n          [t]he  evidence  [introduced against  the\n          defendant  at  trial]  may   be  entirely\n          circumstantial,  and   need  not  exclude\n          every reasonable hypothesis of innocence,\n          that  is, the factfinder may decide among\n          reasonable    interpretations   of    the\n          evidence.\n\nUnited States v. Batista-Polanco,  927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st  Cir.\n                                \n\n1991)(citations omitted).   \n\n          Defendant  has attempted to rely on \"mere presence\"\n\nas a  defense to the  charges of conspiracy,  possession, and\n\ndistribution.    Of  course,  in  establishing  a  conspiracy\n\ncharge, the prosecution must prove intent to agree and commit\n\nthe  substantive  offense beyond  a  reasonable  doubt, Mena-\n                                                             \n\nRobles,  4  F.3d  at 1031.    The  evidence  for such  proof,\n      \n\nhowever, may be either express or inferred  from conduct, and\n\nif  circumstantial  evidence  raises   reasonable  inferences\n\nsufficient to refute the claim of mere presence, it is enough\n\nto sustain the verdict. Id.; Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 18.\n                                            \n\nFurther informing  this analysis  is the  oft-repeated truism\n\nthat participants  in a  criminal conspiracy are  unlikely to\n\npermit or tolerate the  presence of extraneous observers, and\n\na  jury is  presumed  capable of  drawing such  an inference.\n\nUnited States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992). \n                      \n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          In the case at bar, the evidence shows that all the\n\ndrug transactions which form the basis of the indictment took\n\nplace  in  and  around  \"Mi  Pequena  Columbia,\"  defendant's\n\nrestaurant.    There is  ample  evidence  that defendant  was\n\npresent either before,  after, or during each  of the \"buys.\"\n\nThe jury  could reasonably  infer that the  drug transactions\n\nwere  authorized and controlled by  defendant and that he was\n\nthe  source of  supply.   Accordingly, we  reject defendant's\n\ncontention that the evidence of his guilt was insufficient.\n\nB.  Sentencing Claims\n\n          The  court enhanced defendant's  base offense level\n\nby  four levels  for  his role  as an  organizer in  the drug\n\ntrafficking conspiracy,  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1, and  by two levels\n\nfor  obstruction of justice, U.S.S.G.    3C1.1.   At the same\n\ntime, the  court denied defendant's  request for a  two level\n\ndownward   adjustment   for  acceptance   of  responsibility.\n\nDefendant  argues  that  the  court erred  in  each  of these\n\ndeterminations.\n\n          We will  disturb supported findings of a sentencing\n\ncourt only when our review of the record \"convinces us that a\n\ngrave  mistake was made.\"  United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n601, 605 (1st Cir. 1990).  \n\n          1.  Role in the Offense\n\n          Based on  the number of  individuals involved,  the\n\nnature  of  the enterprise,  and  the defendant's  leadership\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nrole,  the  district  court   imposed  a  four  level  upward\n\nadjustment to defendant's base offense level under U.S.S.G.  \n\n3B1.1(a).3    Because role  in  the  offense adjustments  are\n\nnecessarily fact  specific, the  findings  of the  sentencing\n\ncourt are  reviewed under a deferential  standard. See United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Morillo, 8  F.3d 864, 873 (1st Cir. 1993);   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Akitoye, 923  F.2d 221, 227  (1st Cir. 1991).   The\n                 \n\n\"standard  of  review  for  the   sentencing  court's  upward\n\nadjustment for  defendant's leading  role in the  offense ...\n\n[is] clear error.\"   United States v. Reyes, 927  F.2d 48, 50\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          The  evidence established  that  the drug  activity\n\ntook  place  almost  exclusively in  and  around  defendant's\n\nrestaurant.  Moreover, there was testimony to the effect that\n\ntransactions  took  place only  when defendant  was entering,\n\nleaving, or physically  present at the restaurant.  From this\n\nalone  the   judge  could  have   reasonably  concluded  that\n\ndefendant was the  organizer and  leader of a  group of  drug\n\ndealers.   Added to this we have  the testimony of one of the\n\nco-conspirators, Victor  Rodriguez,  that defendant  ran  the\n\noperation, and  that he alone could  determine whether Victor\n\nwas to be paid a commission on the sales he made.\n\n                    \n\n3.  Section 3B1.1(a)  provides that \"If the  defendant was an\norganizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five\nor more participants or  was otherwise extensive, increase by\n4 levels.\"\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n          We  reject defendant's  claim  of error  as to  the\n\nfour-levelenhancement for hisrole in theoffense as meritless.\n\n          2.  Obstruction of Justice\n\n          At trial, Victor Rodriguez testified that defendant\n\nhad  approached  him  during  their  pretrial  detention  and\n\nrequested  that  Victor write  a  letter to  the  trial judge\n\nexplaining that  defendant had  no involvement in  the counts\n\ncharged  in the indictment.   This letter was  solicited as a\n\nquid pro quo, in exchange for which defendant would see to it\n            \n\nthat Victor's family was adequately provided for while Victor\n\nwas incarcerated.  Victor also testified, and the presentence\n\nreport  states,  that co-conspirator  Atilio  threatened that\n\nVictor  would be harmed if  he were to  provide assistance to\n\nthe government.  This was clearly an attempted obstruction of\n\njustice.    Section 3C1.14  of  the guidelines  calls  for an\n\nenhancement  of  two  levels  for  such  conduct.

United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1029 (1st Cir. 1993);  United States v. Hernandez, 995 F.2d 307, 311 (1st Cir. 1993).  Defendant's arrest and indictment followed a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sponsored undercover operation spanning the last five months of 1991.  Five others were also caught in the undercover net and were indicted along with defendant.  Although defendant was the sole defendant at trial, the co-conspirators' names appear in the record and are essential to understand the evidence:  Oscar Gonzalez Lopez;  Daniel Alberto Atilio Adinolfi; Victor Rodriguez Alvarez;  John Doe, a/k/a Edgardo Rodriguez; and Jorge Omar Lopez Almeida.  As is usual in a drug undercover operation, many of the conversations, telephone and face-to-face, were recorded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was the owner-operator of a restaurant called \"Mi Pequena Colombia\" located on Domenech Avenue in Hato Rey.  The undercover operation started on August 21, 1991, when DEA Agent Jefferson Moran and Pablo Rivera, a member of the Police of Puerto Rico assigned to the DEA, met with Oscar Gonzalez Lopez (Oscar) at a shopping center in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.  DEA Agent Moran was introduced to Oscar by Agent Rivera as being interested in buying cocaine or heroin.  Oscar made a telephone call from a public phone booth.  He then asked the agents for $250 to obtain two samples of heroin.  After obtaining the money, he accompanied the agents to Domenech Avenue, where he left the car and headed in the direction of defendant's restaurant.  He returned shortly and gave Agent Moran a cigarette package containing two separate samples of heroin.  Between August 23 and 29, Oscar and Agent Moran discussed, mostly by telephone, the purchase of an ounce of heroin for $7,500.  On August 29, Oscar and the two agents met and went together to defendant's restaurant.  At the restaurant they were introduced to Victor Rodriguez Alvarez (Victor).  Victor asked for the payment of $7,500 before turning over the heroin.  After receiving the money, he went into the restaurant and gave it to the bartender, Edgar Rodriguez Velazquez (Edgar).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Edgar then gave Victor the heroin, who delivered it to Agent Moran.  Victor went back into the restaurant and asked if defendant had called and Edgar said \"No.\" Later, defendant called Edgar and was told that Victor had delivered the merchandise and he, Edgar, had the $7,500.  Sometime later defendant came to the restaurant and the $7,500 was turned over to him by Edgar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 13, 1991, Agent Rivera was called by Victor and it was agreed that Victor would sell Rivera an ounce of heroin for $7,000.  Agent Rivera then proceeded to defendant's restaurant and asked Edgar where Victor was.  Defendant was present when the inquiry was made.  Rivera was told that Victor was at a nearby pizzeria.  Rivera made the \"buy\" at the pizzeria.  He paid Victor $7,000 and received from him an ounce of heroin.  After the transaction, Victor went to defendant's restaurant and met with defendant, Edgar, and Daniel Alberto Atilio Adinolfi (Atilio).  The $7,000 was given to Atilio, who passed it to Edgar, who put it under the counter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 25, 1991, Agent Moran called defendant's restaurant and asked for Victor.  Defendant answered the phone and after the inquiry, put Edgar on the line.  Moran asked Edgar to have Victor call him.  Later Victor called Agent Rivera and they set up a meeting at the pizzeria near defendant's restaurant.  Before meeting Rivera at the pizzeria, Victor went to defendant's restaurant and obtained an ounce of heroin from Atilio.  Defendant and Edgar were at the restaurant at the time the heroin was obtained.  Victor delivered the heroin to Rivera in return for the payment of $7,000.  Victor returned to the restaurant, gave the money to Atilio and asked for his commission.  Atilio refused to give Victor a commission;  instead he referred him to defendant.  Defendant told Victor that no commission would be paid because Victor owed him $200.  This was the end of Victor's dealings with the undercover agents.  Presumably, defendant and his cohorts found out that he had been dealing with a DEA agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late November or early December, the DEA recruited a confidential informant, Eliezer Gallegos, to join its undercover operation.  On December 5, Gallegos met with defendant and Atilio at the restaurant where the purchase of one-half of a kilogram of cocaine for $5,000 was discussed.  On December 6, another negotiation meeting was held at the restaurant.  At the end of the conversation, Atilio told Gallegos that they would take a ride and complete the deal.  Defendant had told Atilio:  \"If he is going to buy the car, take him around for a ride so he will get acquainted with it.\"  Gallegos understood this to mean that the cocaine was in a car.  Gallegos and Atilio left the restaurant, got into a car, and drove around the block.  The \"buy\" was made in the car;  Gallegos paid Atilio $5,000 and received half a kilogram of cocaine.  During the drive around the block they were followed by Jorge Omar Lopez Almeida, who was riding a motorcycle.  Presumably, this was to protect the \"buy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that same day, Gallegos called the restaurant and told Edgar that the half kilo of cocaine was short by six grams.  On December 11, Gallegos called Atilio and told him that the cocaine he had bought was six grams less than the amount agreed upon.  Atilio promised Gallegos that he would make up the shortage the next day and sell him a sample of heroin for $200.  Gallegos went to the restaurant the next day.  Defendant was at a table with two unknown persons.  Atilio was at another table with Edgar.  Gallegos asked Atilio for the six grams of cocaine and the heroin sample.  He was told by Atilio to wait because defendant was busy.  A little later Atilio went over to defendant who gave him a package.  Atilio passed the package to Gallegos.  It contained six grams of cocaine and a heroin sample.  The next day Gallegos went to the restaurant and paid Edgar $200 for the heroin sample.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was stipulated that the drugs bought by the undercover agents and the confidential informant tested out as heroin and cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.  The Rule 29 Motion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the district court erred in denying his Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.  In reviewing the denial of a Rule 29 motion, we consider all the evidence, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom, and resolve all issues of credibility in the light most favorable to the government, in order to determine whether a jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.   Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d at 1031;   Hernandez, 995 F.2d at 311.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of defendant's argument is that he was simply an honest businessman and restauranteur whose misadventure it was that drug dealers operated on his premises without his blessing, knowledge, or participation.  In support of this position, defendant points out that none of the myriad DEA recordings or photographs introduced at trial capture him conducting an illicit drug transaction.  We have reviewed the record carefully and, while we concur with defendant's contention that the government did not produce any direct evidence of his complicity, we must reject both his premise and his conclusion, because neither has a legal basis.  To the contrary, it is a well-established principle that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he evidence [introduced against the defendant at trial] may be entirely circumstantial, and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1991)(citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant has attempted to rely on \"mere presence\" as a defense to the charges of conspiracy, possession, and distribution.  Of course, in establishing a conspiracy charge, the prosecution must prove intent to agree and commit the substantive offense beyond a reasonable doubt,  Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d at 1031.  The evidence for such proof, however, may be either express or inferred from conduct, and if circumstantial evidence raises reasonable inferences sufficient to refute the claim of mere presence, it is enough to sustain the verdict.  Id.; Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 18.  Further informing this analysis is the oft-repeated truism that participants in a criminal conspiracy are unlikely to permit or tolerate the presence of extraneous observers, and a jury is presumed capable of drawing such an inference.   United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, the evidence shows that all the drug transactions which form the basis of the indictment took place in and around \"Mi Pequena Columbia,\" defendant's restaurant.  There is ample evidence that defendant was present either before, after, or during each of the \"buys.\"  The jury could reasonably infer that the drug transactions were authorized and controlled by defendant and that he was the source of supply.  Accordingly, we reject defendant's contention that the evidence of his guilt was insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sentencing Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court enhanced defendant's base offense level by four levels for his role as an organizer in the drug  trafficking conspiracy, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1, and by two levels for obstruction of justice, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  At the same time, the court denied defendant's request for a two level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.  Defendant argues that the court erred in each of these determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will disturb supported findings of a sentencing court only when our review of the record \"convinces us that a grave mistake was made.\"   United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 605 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the number of individuals involved, the nature of the enterprise, and the defendant's leadership role, the district court imposed a four level upward adjustment to defendant's base offense level under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Because role in the offense adjustments are necessarily fact specific, the findings of the sentencing court are reviewed under a deferential standard.   See United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 873 (1st Cir. 1993);  United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 227 (1st Cir. 1991).  The \"standard of review for the sentencing court's upward adjustment for defendant's leading role in the offense ... [is] clear error.\"  United States v.  Reyes, 927 F.2d 48, 50 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence established that the drug activity took place almost exclusively in and around defendant's restaurant.  Moreover, there was testimony to the effect that transactions took place only when defendant was entering, leaving, or physically present at the restaurant.  From this alone the judge could have reasonably concluded that defendant was the organizer and leader of a group of drug dealers.  Added to this we have the testimony of one of the co-conspirators, Victor Rodriguez, that defendant ran the operation, and that he alone could determine whether Victor was to be paid a commission on the sales he made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject defendant's claim of error as to the four- level enhancement for his role in the offense as meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Victor Rodriguez testified that defendant had approached him during their pretrial detention and requested that Victor write a letter to the trial judge explaining that defendant had no involvement in the counts charged in the indictment.  This letter was solicited as a quid pro quo, in exchange for which defendant would see to it that Victor's family was adequately provided for while Victor was incarcerated.  Victor also testified, and the presentence report states, that co-conspirator Atilio threatened that Victor would be harmed if he were to provide assistance to the government.  This was clearly an attempted obstruction of justice.  Section 3C1.1<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> of the guidelines calls for an enhancement of two levels for such conduct.  Such an enhancement, like that for a leadership role in the offense, is fact-based and therefore reviewed for clear error.   United States v. Gonzales, 12 F.3d 298, 299 (1st Cir. 1993);  Akitoye, 923 F.2d at 229.  There was no error, clear or otherwise, by the court in applying the obstruction of justice guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant has a threshold problem in attacking the lower court's determination that he did not qualify for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.  In Gonzales, we held that \"[o]nly 'extraordinary cases' qualify for an acceptance of responsibility credit following an enhancement for obstruction of justice.\"   Gonzales, 12 F.3d at 300, (quoting U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1, comment (n.4)).  In this case, there was testimony at trial and at the sentencing hearing showing that, even after being incarcerated, defendant actively sought to mislead the trial court in order to escape responsibility for the charges against him.  These are the same charges for which he now alleges to have accepted responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only at his presentence interview and in his allocution at the sentencing hearing did defendant accept responsibility for his actions, and he did so only in a limited manner.  The district judge found that \"the defendant had not\" accepted responsibility within the meaning of the guidelines, and that the acceptance made was not authentic and was devoid of remorse.  Findings as to these factors will not be reversed absent clear error.   United States v. Ocasio-Rivera, 991 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1993);  United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Because the sentencing judge has the unique opportunity of observing the defendant, hearing his allocution, and evaluating acceptance of responsibility ... against the backdrop of the case as a whole, his determination is entitled to a great deal of respect.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reject defendant's claim that he was entitled to a two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Named in indictment as John Doe a/k/a Edgardo Rodriguez</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 states, in relevant part:  \"The court on motion of defendant or on its own motion shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the indictment or information after evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Section 3B1.1(a) provides that \"If the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 4 levels.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Section 3C1.1 states:  \"If the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Defendant's arrest and indictment followed a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sponsored undercover operation spanning the last five months of 1991.  Five others were also caught in the undercover net and were indicted along with defendant.  Although defendant was the sole defendant at trial, the co-conspirators' names appear in the record and are essential to understand the evidence:  Oscar Gonzalez Lopez;  Daniel Alberto Atilio Adinolfi; Victor Rodriguez Alvarez;  John Doe, a/k/a Edgardo Rodriguez; and Jorge Omar Lopez Almeida.  As is usual in a drug undercover operation, many of the conversations, telephone and face-to-face, were recorded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was the owner-operator of a restaurant called \"Mi Pequena Colombia\" located on Domenech Avenue in Hato Rey.  The undercover operation started on August 21, 1991, when DEA Agent Jefferson Moran and Pablo Rivera, a member of the Police of Puerto Rico assigned to the DEA, met with Oscar Gonzalez Lopez (Oscar) at a shopping center in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.  DEA Agent Moran was introduced to Oscar by Agent Rivera as being interested in buying cocaine or heroin.  Oscar made a telephone call from a public phone booth.  He then asked the agents for $250 to obtain two samples of heroin.  After obtaining the money, he accompanied the agents to Domenech Avenue, where he left the car and headed in the direction of defendant's restaurant.  He returned shortly and gave Agent Moran a cigarette package containing two separate samples of heroin.  Between August 23 and 29, Oscar and Agent Moran discussed, mostly by telephone, the purchase of an ounce of heroin for $7,500.  On August 29, Oscar and the two agents met and went together to defendant's restaurant.  At the restaurant they were introduced to Victor Rodriguez Alvarez (Victor).  Victor asked for the payment of $7,500 before turning over the heroin.  After receiving the money, he went into the restaurant and gave it to the bartender, Edgar Rodriguez Velazquez (Edgar).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Edgar then gave Victor the heroin, who delivered it to Agent Moran.  Victor went back into the restaurant and asked if defendant had called and Edgar said \"No.\" Later, defendant called Edgar and was told that Victor had delivered the merchandise and he, Edgar, had the $7,500.  Sometime later defendant came to the restaurant and the $7,500 was turned over to him by Edgar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 13, 1991, Agent Rivera was called by Victor and it was agreed that Victor would sell Rivera an ounce of heroin for $7,000.  Agent Rivera then proceeded to defendant's restaurant and asked Edgar where Victor was.  Defendant was present when the inquiry was made.  Rivera was told that Victor was at a nearby pizzeria.  Rivera made the \"buy\" at the pizzeria.  He paid Victor $7,000 and received from him an ounce of heroin.  After the transaction, Victor went to defendant's restaurant and met with defendant, Edgar, and Daniel Alberto Atilio Adinolfi (Atilio).  The $7,000 was given to Atilio, who passed it to Edgar, who put it under the counter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 25, 1991, Agent Moran called defendant's restaurant and asked for Victor.  Defendant answered the phone and after the inquiry, put Edgar on the line.  Moran asked Edgar to have Victor call him.  Later Victor called Agent Rivera and they set up a meeting at the pizzeria near defendant's restaurant.  Before meeting Rivera at the pizzeria, Victor went to defendant's restaurant and obtained an ounce of heroin from Atilio.  Defendant and Edgar were at the restaurant at the time the heroin was obtained.  Victor delivered the heroin to Rivera in return for the payment of $7,000.  Victor returned to the restaurant, gave the money to Atilio and asked for his commission.  Atilio refused to give Victor a commission;  instead he referred him to defendant.  Defendant told Victor that no commission would be paid because Victor owed him $200.  This was the end of Victor's dealings with the undercover agents.  Presumably, defendant and his cohorts found out that he had been dealing with a DEA agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late November or early December, the DEA recruited a confidential informant, Eliezer Gallegos, to join its undercover operation.  On December 5, Gallegos met with defendant and Atilio at the restaurant where the purchase of one-half of a kilogram of cocaine for $5,000 was discussed.  On December 6, another negotiation meeting was held at the restaurant.  At the end of the conversation, Atilio told Gallegos that they would take a ride and complete the deal.  Defendant had told Atilio:  \"If he is going to buy the car, take him around for a ride so he will get acquainted with it.\"  Gallegos understood this to mean that the cocaine was in a car.  Gallegos and Atilio left the restaurant, got into a car, and drove around the block.  The \"buy\" was made in the car;  Gallegos paid Atilio $5,000 and received half a kilogram of cocaine.  During the drive around the block they were followed by Jorge Omar Lopez Almeida, who was riding a motorcycle.  Presumably, this was to protect the \"buy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that same day, Gallegos called the restaurant and told Edgar that the half kilo of cocaine was short by six grams.  On December 11, Gallegos called Atilio and told him that the cocaine he had bought was six grams less than the amount agreed upon.  Atilio promised Gallegos that he would make up the shortage the next day and sell him a sample of heroin for $200.  Gallegos went to the restaurant the next day.  Defendant was at a table with two unknown persons.  Atilio was at another table with Edgar.  Gallegos asked Atilio for the six grams of cocaine and the heroin sample.  He was told by Atilio to wait because defendant was busy.  A little later Atilio went over to defendant who gave him a package.  Atilio passed the package to Gallegos.  It contained six grams of cocaine and a heroin sample.  The next day Gallegos went to the restaurant and paid Edgar $200 for the heroin sample.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was stipulated that the drugs bought by the undercover agents and the confidential informant tested out as heroin and cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.  The Rule 29 Motion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the district court erred in denying his Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.  In reviewing the denial of a Rule 29 motion, we consider all the evidence, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom, and resolve all issues of credibility in the light most favorable to the government, in order to determine whether a jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.   Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d at 1031;   Hernandez, 995 F.2d at 311.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of defendant's argument is that he was simply an honest businessman and restauranteur whose misadventure it was that drug dealers operated on his premises without his blessing, knowledge, or participation.  In support of this position, defendant points out that none of the myriad DEA recordings or photographs introduced at trial capture him conducting an illicit drug transaction.  We have reviewed the record carefully and, while we concur with defendant's contention that the government did not produce any direct evidence of his complicity, we must reject both his premise and his conclusion, because neither has a legal basis.  To the contrary, it is a well-established principle that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he evidence [introduced against the defendant at trial] may be entirely circumstantial, and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>United States v. Batista-Polanco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556636\"><a href=\"/opinion/556636/united-states-v-johnny-rafael-batista-polanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1991)(citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant has attempted to rely on \"mere presence\" as a defense to the charges of conspiracy, possession, and distribution.  Of course, in establishing a conspiracy charge, the prosecution must prove intent to agree and commit the substantive offense beyond a reasonable doubt,  Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d at 1031.  The evidence for such proof, however, may be either express or inferred from conduct, and if circumstantial evidence raises reasonable inferences sufficient to refute the claim of mere presence, it is enough to sustain the verdict.  Id.; Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 18.  Further informing this analysis is the oft-repeated truism that participants in a criminal conspiracy are unlikely to permit or tolerate the presence of extraneous observers, and a jury is presumed capable of drawing such an inference.   United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 712 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, the evidence shows that all the drug transactions which form the basis of the indictment took place in and around \"Mi Pequena Columbia,\" defendant's restaurant.  There is ample evidence that defendant was present either before, after, or during each of the \"buys.\"  The jury could reasonably infer that the drug transactions were authorized and controlled by defendant and that he was the source of supply.  Accordingly, we reject defendant's contention that the evidence of his guilt was insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sentencing Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court enhanced defendant's base offense level by four levels for his role as an organizer in the drug  trafficking conspiracy, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1, and by two levels for obstruction of justice, U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  At the same time, the court denied defendant's request for a two level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.  Defendant argues that the court erred in each of these determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will disturb supported findings of a sentencing court only when our review of the record \"convinces us that a grave mistake was made.\"   United States v. Bradley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 605 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the number of individuals involved, the nature of the enterprise, and the defendant's leadership role, the district court imposed a four level upward adjustment to defendant's base offense level under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Because role in the offense adjustments are necessarily fact specific, the findings of the sentencing court are reviewed under a deferential standard.   See United States v. Morillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 873 (1st Cir. 1993);  United States v. Akitoye, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554021\"><a href=\"/opinion/554021/united-states-v-adegboyega-akitoye/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 227 (1st Cir. 1991).  The \"standard of review for the sentencing court's upward adjustment for defendant's leading role in the offense ... [is] clear error.\"  United States v.  Reyes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556643\"><a href=\"/opinion/556643/united-states-v-jose-enrique-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence established that the drug activity took place almost exclusively in and around defendant's restaurant.  Moreover, there was testimony to the effect that transactions took place only when defendant was entering, leaving, or physically present at the restaurant.  From this alone the judge could have reasonably concluded that defendant was the organizer and leader of a group of drug dealers.  Added to this we have the testimony of one of the co-conspirators, Victor Rodriguez, that defendant ran the operation, and that he alone could determine whether Victor was to be paid a commission on the sales he made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject defendant's claim of error as to the four- level enhancement for his role in the offense as meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Victor Rodriguez testified that defendant had approached him during their pretrial detention and requested that Victor write a letter to the trial judge explaining that defendant had no involvement in the counts charged in the indictment.  This letter was solicited as a quid pro quo, in exchange for which defendant would see to it that Victor's family was adequately provided for while Victor was incarcerated.  Victor also testified, and the presentence report states, that co-conspirator Atilio threatened that Victor would be harmed if he were to provide assistance to the government.  This was clearly an attempted obstruction of justice.  Section 3C1.1<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> of the guidelines calls for an enhancement of two levels for such conduct.  Such an enhancement, like that for a leadership role in the offense, is fact-based and therefore reviewed for clear error.   United States v. Gonzales, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195106\"><a href=\"/opinion/195106/united-states-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 299 (1st Cir. 1993);  Akitoye, 923 F.2d at 229.  There was no error, clear or otherwise, by the court in applying the obstruction of justice guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant has a threshold problem in attacking the lower court's determination that he did not qualify for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.  In Gonzales, we held that \"[o]nly 'extraordinary cases' qualify for an acceptance of responsibility credit following an enhancement for obstruction of justice.\"   Gonzales, 12 F.3d at 300, (quoting U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1, comment (n.4)).  In this case, there was testimony at trial and at the sentencing hearing showing that, even after being incarcerated, defendant actively sought to mislead the trial court in order to escape responsibility for the charges against him.  These are the same charges for which he now alleges to have accepted responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only at his presentence interview and in his allocution at the sentencing hearing did defendant accept responsibility for his actions, and he did so only in a limited manner.  The district judge found that \"the defendant had not\" accepted responsibility within the meaning of the guidelines, and that the acceptance made was not authentic and was devoid of remorse.  Findings as to these factors will not be reversed absent clear error.   United States v. Ocasio-Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604815\"><a href=\"/opinion/604815/united-states-v-richard-ocasio-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1993);  United States v.
