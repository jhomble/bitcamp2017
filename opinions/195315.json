This  case appears before us for  a second\n          Per Curiam.\n                    \n\ntime.  In the earlier proceeding, we vacated the district court's\n\norder  dismissing plaintiffs' libel claim.   See Aponte v. Puerto\n                                                                 \n\nRico Marine Mgmt.,  Inc., No.  92-2056 (1st Cir.  Mar. 16,  1993)\n                        \n\n(unpublished).   On remand, defendant moved  for summary judgment\n\non the libel claim.  The district court, in a thoughtful opinion,\n\nfound   that  the   uncontradicted  evidence   showed   that  the\n\npublication  of  the  allegedly  defamatory  comments  was  quite\n\nlimited and  fell comfortably within  the scope of  the qualified\n\nprivilege recognized by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court in Porto v.\n                                                              \n\nBentley Puerto  Rico, Inc., No.  RE-89-123 (P.R.

Plaintiffs appeal.  We affirm.\n\n          As  we have  indicated  before, when  a district  court\n\nproduces a well-reasoned opinion that reaches the correct result,\n\na reviewing tribunal should not rush to write at length merely to\n\nput matters in its own  words.  See, e.g., In re  San Juan Dupont\n                                                                 \n\nPlaza Hotel Fire Litig., 989  F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).  So it\n                       \n\nis here.  We agree  with the court below that, in this  case, the\n\nsummary judgment  record contains  no  evidence that  defendant's\n\npublication  of the alleged libel  fell outside the  scope of the\n\nqualified  privilege  available  under  Puerto  Rico  law.    We,\n\ntherefore, summarily affirm the judgment below, for substantially\n\nthe reasons articulated in the district court's rescript.  We add\n\nonly  that, in all  events, we  are hard-pressed  to see  how the\n\ncommunication in question canplausibly be classified as libelous.\n\n                                2\n\n          We  need go no further.   The judgment  of the district\n\ncourt is \n\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n              \n\n                                3\n",
