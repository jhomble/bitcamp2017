Her curiosity unslaked by the meager responses\n\nto her request, she sued.  The federal district court ordered the\n\nagencies to explain their  search methodologies in greater detail\n\nand  reviewed some withheld documents in camera.  Finding no FOIA\n                                               \n\nviolations,  the court granted  summary judgment in  favor of all\n\ndefendants.\n\n          Ms. Sullivan  appeals with respect only  to the Central\n\nIntelligence  Agency (CIA).1    She limits  her  argument to  the\n\nadequacy  of the CIA's file  search and the  applicability of the\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of\n\n1992  (JFK  Act), Pub.  L. No.  102-526,  106 Stat.  3443 (1992).\n\nAfter  \"indulging  all  reasonable  inferences  in  [appellant's]\n\nfavor,\"  Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990),\n                             \n\nas the summary judgment standard necessitates, we affirm.\n\nI.  A POSSIBLE MISSION\n\n          Appellant's  father, Geoffrey Sullivan, and his quondam\n\ncolleague, Alexander Rorke, were last seen on September 24, 1963,\n\nleaving  Cozemel, Mexico  in a  twin-engine  Beechcraft airplane.\n\nThough the pair  filed a flight  plan for Tegucigalpa,  Honduras,\n\nthey  never arrived.  A  search ensued, but  neither the aircraft\n\nnor its occupants were found.\n\n                    \n\n     1In  view of this limitation,  we omit any  reference to the\nother eight agencies in the pages that follow.\n\n                                2\n\n          In later years, appellant  grew determined to solve the\n\nmystery  of  her  father's  disappearance.     On  the  basis  of\n\ninterviews   and  an   inspection   of  declassified   government\n\ndocuments,  appellant surmised  that  Rorke and  her father  were\n\nengaged in a CIA-sponsored mission to drop propaganda (or perhaps\n\nsomething  more  sinister)   over  Cuba.     Despite  appellant's\n\nsuspicions, the  CIA steadfastly  refused to acknowledge  that it\n\nemployed either man at any time.\n\n          Undaunted, appellant requested that the CIA provide her\n\nwith documents about  the missing  men.  The  agency perused  its\n\nnon-operational  files, finding no  data about  Geoffrey Sullivan\n\nand  a few,  apparently  inconsequential, documents  relating  to\n\nRorke.    When the  agency  balked at  searching  its operational\n\nfiles, appellant instituted the instant action.\n\nII.  THE FOIA CLAIM\n\n          We begin by exploring the intersection between FOIA and\n\nthe CIA Information Act of 1984, 50 U.S.C.    431-432 (1988).  We\n\nthen apply the statutory framework to the case at bar.\n\n                     A.  Statutory Structure.\n                                            \n\n          In general,  FOIA requires that upon  due inquiry every\n\nfederal agency \"shall make [requested] records promptly available\n\nto any person.\"   5 U.S.C.    552(a)(3).   This broad command  is\n\nhedged by  nine exemptions.   See 5  U.S.C.    552(b).   Although\n                                 \n\nthese exemptions cover much  of what typically might be  found in\n\n                                3\n\nCIA  operational files,2 FOIA does not give the CIA carte blanche\n\nto  refrain from  producing  documents merely  because  it is  an\n\nintelligence agency.  Consequently, the CIA had to divert trained\n\nintelligence  officers  to  search  its  entire  file  system  in\n\nresponse to FOIA requests, notwithstanding the relatively limited\n\nnumber of non-exempt documents likely to be culled.   See S. Rep.\n                                                         \n\nNo.  305, 98th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.  6-7  (1983).    To  curb  the\n\ninefficiencies inherent in applying standard FOIA requirements to\n\nthe arcane realm  of the  CIA, Congress, acting  pursuant to  its\n\nreserved  power to  insert  additional FOIA  exemptions in  other\n\nstatutory enactments, see 5  U.S.C.   552(b)(3); see also  CIA v.\n                                                              \n\nSims, 471  U.S. 159, 167-68  (1985) (acknowledging  that the  CIA\n    \n\nInformation  Act creates  FOIA exemptions);  Maynard v.  CIA, 986\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  547,  555  (1st  Cir.  1993)  (similar),   passed  the  CIA\n\nInformation Act.\n\n          The Information  Act addressed the problem  by excusing\n\nthe  CIA from searching its operational files in response to most\n\nFOIA requests.   Operational files, i.e.,  files that memorialize\n                                        \n\nthe conduct  and means  of the government's  foreign intelligence\n\nand counterintelligence efforts, see 50  U.S.C.   431(b), are the\n                                    \n\nmost sensitive of the CIA's records and, thus, the most likely to\n\nneed an extra  measure of protection.  Recognizing, however, that\n\noperational files  can be highly informative,  Congress carefully\n\n                    \n\n     2For example, FOIA does not require production of classified\nnational  defense  and  foreign  policy  documents,  5  U.S.C.   \n552(b)(1),  trade   secrets  or  other   confidential  commercial\ninformation,   5  U.S.C.       552(b)(4),  or   law   enforcement\ninvestigatory files, 5 U.S.C.   552(b)(7).\n\n                                4\n\ncarved out  three areas in which  requestors, notwithstanding the\n\nstatutory    bar,    might    nonetheless   receive    materials.\n\nSpecifically, the CIA must search such files and produce relevant\n\ninformation if a document request is\n\n          (1) [from] United States citizens . . . \n          who have requested information on themselves\n          . . . ; [or]\n\n          (2)  [regarding]  any  special  activity  the\n          existence  of   which  is  not   exempt  from\n          disclosure under [FOIA]; [or]\n\n          (3)  the   specific  subject  matter   of  an\n          investigation by  the intelligence committees\n          of the Congress,  the Intelligence  Oversight\n          Board, the Department  of Justice, the Office\n          of  General Counsel of  the [CIA], the Office\n          of  Inspector General  of the  [CIA], or  the\n          Office   of   the    Director   of    Central\n          Intelligence   for    any   impropriety,   or\n          violation   of   law,  Executive   order,  or\n          Presidential directive, in the conduct of any\n          intelligence activity.\n\n50 U.S.C.   431(c).   In sum, then, the  statutory exceptions are\n\nfor first-party requests, special activity requests, and requests\n\nthat focus on  investigations of  improprieties in  intelligence-\n\ngathering activities.\n\n                   B.  Applying the Exceptions.\n                                              \n\n          Although appellant asserts that her information request\n\nimplicates each  of the three  exceptions quoted above,  we think\n\nnone of them apply in this case.  We explain briefly.\n\n          1.   First-Party Requests.  Restricting  this aspect of\n          1.   First-Party Requests.\n                                   \n\nher  appeal to the information she solicits about her father, Ms.\n\nSullivan  asseverates that  the CIA  must search  its operational\n\nfiles   for  responsive  documents   because  section  431(c)(1),\n\n                                5\n\nproperly interpreted, requires the agency, on request, to produce\n\ninformation about the requestor's next-of-kin.  We disagree. \n\n          Appellant arrives at her  rather curious reading of the\n\nstatute  by a two-step pavane.  She says, first, that the statute\n\nis  vague as  to  rights of  next-of-kin;  and second,  that  the\n\nlegislative history  resolves the uncertainty  in her favor.   We\n\nfind  neither  step  to be  consistent  with  the  rhythm of  the\n\nInformation Act.\n\n          Section 431(c)(1) is anything but murky.  The statute's\n\nlanguage  limits the exclusion to  \"United States citizens  . . .\n\nwho  have requested  information  on themselves.\"    50 U.S.C.   \n\n431(c)(1).   While appellant suggests that,  in context, the word\n\n\"themselves\"  is  ambiguous, we  are  confident  that the  word's\n\ncommon meaning   \"those identical ones that  are they,\" Webster's\n                                                                 \n\nThird New  International Dictionary  2370 (1986)     is not  only\n                                   \n\npalpably plain  but is also anathematic  to appellant's rendition\n\nof  the exception.  The lack of ambiguity entirely undermines Ms.\n\nSullivan's  position.   Courts  will only  look behind  statutory\n\nlanguage in the rare case where a literal reading must be shunned\n\nbecause it  would produce  an absurd  outcome, see,  e.g., Public\n                                                                 \n\nCitizen v. United  States Dep't of Justice, 109 S. Ct. 2558, 2566\n                                          \n\n(1989)  (\"Where the  literal reading  of a  statutory  term would\n\ncompel  an odd result, [courts] must search for other evidence of\n\ncongressional intent . .  . .\") (citation and internal  quotation\n\nmarks omitted), or  when the legislature  has otherwise blown  an\n\nuncertain  trumpet.  See  Morales v. Trans  World Airlines, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n                                6\n\n112  S. Ct. 2031, 2036 (1992); FMC  Corp. v. Holliday, 111 S. Ct.\n                                                     \n\n403, 407 (1990); see  also United States v. Aversa, 984 F.2d 493,\n                                                  \n\n499 n.8 (1st Cir. 1993) (en banc) (reiterating that where statute\n\nis  clear,  further  hermeneutics  are  unnecessary)  (collecting\n\ncases).  Here, reading the statute literally produces a perfectly\n\nplausible result  and the  clarity of  the  statutory command  is\n\nstunning.   That  ends the  matter:   if  Congress had  wished to\n\ncreate a right for next-of-kin, it could   and, we think, would  \n\nhave done so explicitly.\n\n          The second step of appellant's section 431(c)(1) pavane\n\nis equally bollixed.  The  legislative history of the Information\n\nAct  reinforces  rather  than  weakens  the  unrelievedly  narrow\n\nconstruction  of  the first-party  exception  that the  statutory\n\nlanguage portends.   See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 305, at 17-18.  While\n                              \n\nsome members of Congress  apparently believed that the CIA  would\n\ntreat  next-of-kin   requests  \"generously,\"  id.  at   18,  such\n                                                 \n\ngenerosity was  obviously meant to  be a  matter of  grace.   The\n\nSenate Report  states unequivocally:  \"This  legislation does not\n\ngive next-of-kin a right to request information about a  deceased\n\nperson.\"   Id. at 17.  The  predictions of individual senators to\n              \n\nthe  effect that an agency, once empowered, will act with greater\n\ngenerosity  than  it  is  obliged  to  exhibit  cannot  serve  to\n\noverwhelm the letter of the law.\n\n          We  have said  enough.   Neither  the  text of  section\n\n431(c)(1) nor its legislative  history support a right  of access\n\nto  CIA operational  files  for next-of-kin  requestors.   Hence,\n\n                                7\n\nappellant cannot wield  the first-party exception  as a wedge  to\n\nloosen the restrictions that safeguard CIA operational files.\n\n          2.  Special Activity  Requests.  Appellant's next claim\n          2.  Special Activity  Requests.\n                                        \n\nis  that the CIA must  produce the information  she seeks because\n\nher request relates to a \"special activity\" within the purview of\n\n50  U.S.C.   431(c)(2).  In this instance, the statute's language\n\nprovides relatively  scant guidance, other than  to mandate that,\n\nin  addition to having  a special activity  linkage, the material\n\nmust not otherwise be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.  See id.\n                                                                 \n\nThe statute is silent in a critical respect; neither its text nor\n\nits   structure   afford   a   meaningful   insight   into   what\n\ncharacteristics  of a CIA activity  make it \"special.\"   We turn,\n\ntherefore,  to the  legislative  history.   See, e.g.,  Greenwood\n                                                                 \n\nTrust Co. v.  Massachusetts, 971  F.2d 818, 824  (1st Cir.  1992)\n                           \n\n(discussing preferred approaches  to statutory construction where\n\na statute's text leaves  unanswered questions), cert. denied, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. 974 (1993).\n\n          House  and  Senate  reports  make  clear that  Congress\n\ndesigned the special activity exception to allow public access to\n\ndeclassified information while still permitting the CIA to refuse\n\nto  confirm  or  deny  the  existence  of  documents relating  to\n\nclassified covert operations.  See H.R. Rep. No. 726, 98th Cong.,\n                                  \n\n2d Sess. 27 (1984); S. Rep. No. 305, at 24.  To accommodate these\n\ncompeting  objectives,  the special  activity  provision  must be\n\nconstrued  in  light  of two  basic  concerns:   specificity  and\n\nsecrecy.\n\n                                8\n\n          As to the specificity  prong, a requestor must identify\n\na  particular CIA activity in connection with his or her request.\n             \n\nThe  House report accompanying the Information  Act tells us that\n\nthe term \"special activity\"\n\n          means  any  activity  of  the  United  States\n          Government, other than  an activity  intended\n          solely for  obtaining necessary intelligence,\n          which  is  planned and  executed so  that the\n          role of the United  States is not apparent or\n          acknowledged   publicly,  and   functions  in\n          support   of  any  such   activity,  but  not\n          including diplomatic activities.\n\nH.R.  Rep. No.  726, at  28.   The Senate  added content  to this\n\nexplanation by  furnishing examples.  Thus,  requests must relate\n\nto  \"a specific covert action operation,  such as the Bay of Pigs\n\ninvasion or the CIA's role in replacement of the Guatemala regime\n\nin the 1950s . . . .\"  S. Rep. No. 305, at 24-25.  By contrast, a\n\nrequest  is  insufficiently specific  \"if  it refers  to  a broad\n\ncategory or type of covert action operations.\"  Id. at 25.  As an\n                                                   \n\nexample of  an inadequately  particularized  request, the  Senate\n\nreport mentions  one that  is \"predicated on  declassification of\n\nthe existence of CIA covert  efforts to counter Soviet  influence\n\nin Western Europe during the 1950s . . . .\"  Id.\n                                                \n\n          Appellant  argues  on appeal  that the  information she\n\nseeks is part and parcel of a particular \"special activity\":  the\n\nCIA's  unremitting efforts  to  overthrow Cuban  President  Fidel\n\nCastro.  Although the  parties dispute whether appellant espoused\n\nthis  theory before the district  court, we need  not resolve the\n\nquestion  of  waiver because  it is  apparent  that, even  in its\n\npresent incarnation, appellant's theory  is unavailing:  it rests\n\n                                9\n\non  CIA activity that is too expansively described to slip within\n\nthe integument of section 431(c)(2).\n\n          In an effort to prove the contrary, appellant seizes on\n\nan example limned  in the  Senate report and  proclaims that  the\n\ncoup deposing  Guatemalan  President Arbenz  in  1954 is  a  fair\n\ncongener to the  special activity  she has described.   We  think\n\nnot.   While equating the two might produce a certain superficial\n\nsymmetry, doing  so flies in the  teeth of history.   There is an\n\nessential  difference in  the magnitude  and scope  of the  anti-\n\nArbenz  and anti-Castro  campaigns.   President  Arbenz fled  his\n\ncountry at the conclusion of a CIA-inspired operation that lasted\n\nonly a  few months and  involved only a  handful of agents.   See\n                                                                 \n\nJeremiah O'Leary, Tricks of the Coup Trade, Wash. Times, Dec. 19,\n                                          \n\n1989,  at F3;  see generally  Julius Pratt,  A History  of United\n                                                                 \n\nStates Foreign Policy 532-33  (1965).  Like the Bay  of Pigs, the\n                     \n\noverthrow of  the Guatemalan government was  a discrete operation\n\nwith  a  beginning,  an end,  and  a  circumscribed  middle.   In\n\ncontrast, the CIA's campaign against  Castro has been ongoing for\n\ndecades.  By all accounts, it has involved widespread efforts and\n\nhordes of people.  Indeed, the CIA's role in respect  to Castro's\n\nCuba is more properly analogous to CIA operations  against Soviet\n\ninfluence in Western Europe during the 1950s, a course of conduct\n\nwhich  the  Senate specifically  indicated  was  too sweeping  to\n\ntrigger  the special  activity  exception, than  to  the coup  in\n\nGuatemala.\n\n          We turn now to the second prong:  secrecy.  The special\n\n                                10\n\nactivity provision also requires  that the requested material not\n\nbe exempt from disclosure  under FOIA.  At  the very least,  this\n\nmeans that the data must be either unclassified  or declassified.\n\nSee  5 U.S.C.     552(b)(1)(B) (establishing  FOIA exemption  for\n   \n\nclassified  materials).   Declassification  occurs only  when \"an\n\nauthorized  Executive Branch official has officially and publicly\n\nacknowledged the existence . . . of a specific special activity.\"\n\nS. Rep. No. 305, at 24; see also Hunt v. CIA, 981 F.2d 1116, 1121\n                                            \n\n(9th  Cir. 1992) (recognizing that  the CIA need  not release any\n\ninformation   on  special  activities  that  remain  classified).\n\nAppellant's  request fails  this prong  of the  section 431(c)(2)\n\ntest  because  the  activity  about  which  she  inquires is  not\n\ngenerally declassified.   The mere fact that the CIA acknowledges\n\ninvolvement in  an  incident or,  more broadly,  in a  particular\n\nregion  of the world, does  not justify the  release of documents\n\nwhich touch, however distantly, on that incident or region.\n\n          Of  course, certain  aspects  of the  CIA's efforts  to\n\ndestabilize the Castro regime  are in the public domain  (the Bay\n\nof Pigs, for one).  Nonetheless appellant's initial FOIA  request\n\napparently  did not  seek  information related  to the  subjects'\n\nparticipation  in any  specific  (declassified) operations,3  but\n\nsimply inquired about  the two men    whose  alleged role in  CIA\n\naffairs  has never  been acknowledged  by either  the CIA  or any\n\n                    \n\n     3We are  frank to acknowledge  that the appellate  record is\nnot entirely pellucid in  this regard.  Appellant,  however, must\nbear   the  onus  of  such  shortcomings  in  the  record.    See\n                                                                 \nMassachusetts  v.

In this  case, such  a  level of  generality is\n\nnecessarily  fatal.  With respect  to CIA operations,  \"it is one\n\nthing . . . to speculate or guess that a thing may  be so . . . ;\n\nit is quite  another thing for one  in a position  to know of  it\n\nofficially to  say that it is  so.\"  Fitzgibbon v.

That   some  operations   against  Cuba   have  been\n                        \n\ndeclassified  is  insufficient  to   throw  open  all  CIA  files\n                                                     \n\nregarding Cuba.\n\n          At bottom, the interleaved  fact that appellant did not\n\ninitially identify (i) a  particular operation against the Castro\n\nregime  that (ii) is declassified  and in which  she believed her\n\nfather  participated,  defeats  her   effort  to  invoke  section\n\n431(c)(2).\n\n          3.  Investigatory  Requests.  Finally, appellant  hawks\n          3.  Investigatory  Requests.\n                                     \n\nthe notion  that because  a Senate  Select Committee  (the Church\n\nCommittee) inquired  into certain covert  operations against Cuba\n\nmounted by the CIA and other (putatively independent) anti-Castro\n\ngroups,4  the information  she requests  comprises  \"the specific\n\nsubject  matter   of  an   investigation  by   [an]  intelligence\n\ncommittee[]  of  the  Congress .  .  .  for  any impropriety,  or\n\n                    \n\n     4The Church Committee eventually filed a  compendious report\nof its investigation.  See The Investigation of the Assassination\n                                                                 \nof  President John F.  Kennedy:  Performance  of the Intelligence\n                                                                 \nAgencies, S. Rep. No. 755, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. (1976).\n        \n\n                                12\n\nviolation  of  law .  .  .  in  the conduct  of  an  intelligence\n\nactivity.\"  50 U.S.C.   431(c)(3).  In our view, appellant's FOIA\n\nrequest does not fall within the exception's province.\n\n          As the statute's language and legislative  history make\n\nclear,  see  id.;  see  also  H.R. Rep.  No.  726,  at  28-31,  a\n                            \n\ncongressional  investigation that  touches  on CIA  conduct in  a\n\nparticular incident or region,  standing alone, is not sufficient\n\nto warrant the release  of all CIA documents anent  that incident\n\nor  region.   Instead,  the congressional  investigation and  the\n\ndocuments sought must specifically relate to CIA wrongdoing, that\n\nis,  some \"impropriety\" or \"violation  of law\" in  the conduct of\n\nthe  designated intelligence  activity.   50 U.S.C.    431(c)(3).\n\nThe primary mission of the Church Committee, as appellant admits,\n\nwas   to  examine   the   relationship,  if   any,  between   the\n\nassassination  of  President  Kennedy,   on  the  one  hand,  and\n\nAmerican-sponsored operations  against Cuba, on the  second hand.\n\nIn  the course  of its  work,  the Committee  considered American\n\noperations against Castro and,  inevitably, their legality.  Seen\n\nfrom  that  perspective, the  Committee's  mission  does not  fit\n\nwithin the contours of section 431(c)(3) for two reasons.  First,\n\nthe  Committee's inquiry was not a  direct investigation into CIA\n\nwrongdoing.   Second, appellant's  request for  information about\n\nher   father's  disappearance   bears  no   claimed  or   readily\n\ndiscernible relationship to  the investigation's purposes.   This\n\nlatter  obstacle is  insurmountable:   a  pivotal requirement  of\n\nsection  431(c)(3) is  that, to  be extractable,  the information\n\n                                13\n\nrequested  must  concern  the  specific  subject  matter  of  the\n\nofficial investigation.   Thus, although there  were instances in\n\nwhich  the  Committee   searched  for  agency  misconduct,   that\n\nhappenstance does  not allow  appellant to catapult  herself over\n\nthe  statutory parapet.  It is simply not enough that information\n\nwhich bore  in some remote  way on  the request  surfaced in  the\n\ncourse of an official investigation.   See H.R. Rep. No.  726, at\n                                          \n\n30-31.\n\n          Appellant   also   points  hopefully,   albeit  without\n\ndeveloped  argumentation,  to  the   work  of  the  House  Select\n\nCommittee  on  Assassinations  (HSCA).    This  committee  probed\n\nwhether  the  CIA might  have  played  a  role in  the  death  of\n\nPresident Kennedy, see H.R.  Rep. No. 1828, 95th Cong.,  2d Sess.\n                      \n\n(1979), concluding that it did not.  Id. at 3.  Assuming arguendo\n                                                                 \n\nthat the HSCA investigation centered on potential CIA wrongdoing,\n\nits work still cannot serve as a vehicle for bringing appellant's\n\nrequest within the statutory exception.  Appellant is not seeking\n\ninformation on  the CIA's role  in the Kennedy  assassination and\n\nhas  not alleged  that either  her father  or Rorke  was directly\n\ninvolved in  any such machinations.   Hence, because  her request\n\ndoes  not   overlap  the   \"specific  subject  matter   of  [the]\n\ninvestigation,\" 50 U.S.C.    431(c)(3), she  cannot use the  HSCA\n\nreport as a  means to  escape the strictures  of the  Information\n\nAct.\n\n          We rule, therefore, that neither the Church Committee's\n\ninvestigation nor HSCA's probe is sufficiently sturdy a bootstrap\n\n                                14\n\nto  lift appellant's FOIA request over the hurdles erected by the\n\ncongressional investigation exception to the Information Act.5\n\nIII.  THE JFK ACT CLAIM\n\n          After the district court entered summary  judgment, but\n\nbefore  appellant briefed  this appeal,  Congress passed  the JFK\n\nAct,  Pub. L.  No.  102-526, 106  Stat.  3443  (1992).   The  Act\n\nrequires    that   records   related   to   President   Kennedy's\n\nassassination be transferred to  the National Archives where they\n\nare to be made publicly  available, subject to certain stipulated\n\nconditions.   Id.   5.   The Act constructs a  process   distinct\n                 \n\nfrom FOIA    by which the public can search those documents in an\n\nalmost unfettered  fashion.  See id.    4.  In  a peroration that\n                                    \n\nsheds considerably  more heat  than  light, appellant  insinuates\n\nthat her father's disappearance might  be tied in some  undefined\n\nway  to President  Kennedy's assassination  and implores  that we\n\norder the district court to review  her information request under\n\nthe new  law's disclosure  provisions.  Her  argument is  policy-\n\ndriven; in her view, federal courts should go to great lengths to\n\norder documents produced  under the JFK  Act because the  statute\n\ninstructs agencies to \"give priority to . . . the identification,\n\nreview, and transmission, under the standards of postponement set\n\nforth in this Act,  of assassination records that on the  date of\n\nenactment  of  this  Act  are  the  subject of  litigation  under\n\n                    \n\n     5Having  disposed of appellant's  initiative on this ground,\nwe  need not consider whether either the Church Committee or HSCA\nwas an  \"intelligence committee[]\" within the  meaning of section\n431(c)(3).\n\n                                15\n\n[FOIA].\"  See id.   5(c)(2)(G).\n                 \n\n          We are  unconvinced.  The  JFK Act, like  FOIA, assigns\n\nprimary responsibility for assessing information  requests to the\n\nExecutive Branch.   Judicial review is merely a safeguard against\n\nagency action  that proves arbitrary, capricious,  or contrary to\n\nlaw, not  an option  of first  resort.  We  can discern  no valid\n\nreason  to  throw  caution  to  the winds,  disrupt  the  orderly\n\nworkings of the statutory scheme, and instruct the district court\n\nto  dive headlong  into  uncharted waters.    Doing so  would  be\n\npremature from  virtually every  standpoint:  the  compilation of\n\nrecords required by the JFK Act has not been completed, appellant\n\nhas not  invoked the administrative processes  afforded under the\n\nlegislation,  no agency action has  been taken thereunder, and, a\n                                                                 \n\nfortiori,  there is no administrative record for a court to mull.\n        \n\nSee  Assassination Archives  &amp;  Research Ctr.  v.  U.S. Dep't  of\n                                                                 \n\nJustice,      F. Supp.      ,     n.3 (D.D.C. 1993) [No. 92-2193;\n                                 \n\nslip op. at 12 n.3] (finding similar JFK Act claim unripe).\n\n          We  need go no further.  Appellant has boldly grafted a\n\nneoteric JFK Act claim  that belongs before the Archivist  of the\n\nUnited States onto  her FOIA appeal.   Since there  is no  agency\n\naction   for  the  district  court  to   review,  we  decline  to\n\nparticipate in so  radical an experiment.   See JFK Act,    11(c)\n                                               \n\n(providing  for  judicial  review  of \"final  actions\"  taken  by\n\nagencies).\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          Although we sympathize with appellant's desire to learn\n\n                                16\n\nthe  details of her father's fate, she, like all other litigants,\n\nmust  abide by the rules.   Congress crafted  the CIA Information\n\nAct  to  strike  a  balance  between  public  disclosure  and  an\n\neffective intelligence apparatus.   Our role  is not to  reassess\n\nthe relative  interests, see Sims, 471  U.S. at 180, or  to yield\n                                 \n\nwhenever human  sympathies are engaged,  but simply to  apply the\n\nlaw  as Congress wrote it.   Given the  generality of appellant's\n\nrequest and  the stringent standard of  confidentiality contained\n\nin the Information Act,  the district court appropriately granted\n\nsummary  judgment in the government's favor.  Further, as we have\n\nexplained,  the   freshly  minted  JFK  Act   claim  provides  no\n\nprincipled basis for  a remand  and, thus, no  detour around  the\n\nruling below.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                17\n",

A POSSIBLE MISSION\n\n          Appellant's  father, Geoffrey Sullivan, and his quondam\n\ncolleague, Alexander Rorke, were last seen on September 24, 1963,\n\nleaving  Cozemel, Mexico  in a  twin-engine  Beechcraft airplane.\n\nThough the pair  filed a flight  plan for Tegucigalpa,  Honduras,\n\nthey  never arrived.  A  search ensued, but  neither the aircraft\n\nnor its occupants were found.\n\n                    \n\n     1In  view of this limitation,  we omit any  reference to the\nother eight agencies in the pages that follow.\n\n                                2\n\n          In later years, appellant  grew determined to solve the\n\nmystery  of  her  father's  disappearance.     On  the  basis  of\n\ninterviews   and  an   inspection   of  declassified   government\n\ndocuments,  appellant surmised  that  Rorke and  her father  were\n\nengaged in a CIA-sponsored mission to drop propaganda (or perhaps\n\nsomething  more  sinister)   over  Cuba.     Despite  appellant's\n\nsuspicions, the  CIA steadfastly  refused to acknowledge  that it\n\nemployed either man at any time.\n\n          Undaunted, appellant requested that the CIA provide her\n\nwith documents about  the missing  men.  The  agency perused  its\n\nnon-operational  files, finding no  data about  Geoffrey Sullivan\n\nand  a few,  apparently  inconsequential, documents  relating  to\n\nRorke.    When the  agency  balked at  searching  its operational\n\nfiles, appellant instituted the instant action.\n\nII.  THE FOIA CLAIM\n\n          We begin by exploring the intersection between FOIA and\n\nthe CIA Information Act of 1984, 50 U.S.C.    431-432 (1988).  We\n\nthen apply the statutory framework to the case at bar.\n\n                     A.  Statutory Structure.\n                                            \n\n          In general,  FOIA requires that upon  due inquiry every\n\nfederal agency \"shall make [requested] records promptly available\n\nto any person.\"   5 U.S.C.    552(a)(3).   This broad command  is\n\nhedged by  nine exemptions.   See 5  U.S.C.    552(b).   Although\n                                 \n\nthese exemptions cover much  of what typically might be  found in\n\n                                3\n\nCIA  operational files,2 FOIA does not give the CIA carte blanche\n\nto  refrain from  producing  documents merely  because  it is  an\n\nintelligence agency.  Consequently, the CIA had to divert trained\n\nintelligence  officers  to  search  its  entire  file  system  in\n\nresponse to FOIA requests, notwithstanding the relatively limited\n\nnumber of non-exempt documents likely to be culled.   See S. Rep.\n                                                         \n\nNo.  305, 98th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.  6-7  (1983).    To  curb  the\n\ninefficiencies inherent in applying standard FOIA requirements to\n\nthe arcane realm  of the  CIA, Congress, acting  pursuant to  its\n\nreserved  power to  insert  additional FOIA  exemptions in  other\n\nstatutory enactments, see 5  U.S.C.   552(b)(3); see also  CIA v.\n                                                              \n\nSims, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111410\"><a href=\"/opinion/111410/cia-v-sims/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167-68  (1985) (acknowledging  that the  CIA\n    \n\nInformation  Act creates  FOIA exemptions);  Maynard v.

Operational files, i.e.,  files that memorialize\n                                        \n\nthe conduct  and means  of the government's  foreign intelligence\n\nand counterintelligence efforts, see 50  U.S.C.   431(b), are the\n                                    \n\nmost sensitive of the CIA's records and, thus, the most likely to\n\nneed an extra  measure of protection.  Recognizing, however, that\n\noperational files  can be highly informative,  Congress carefully\n\n                    \n\n     2For example, FOIA does not require production of classified\nnational  defense  and  foreign  policy  documents,  5  U.S.C.   \n552(b)(1),  trade   secrets  or  other   confidential  commercial\ninformation,   5  U.S.C.       552(b)(4),  or   law   enforcement\ninvestigatory files, 5 U.S.C.   552(b)(7).\n\n                                4\n\ncarved out  three areas in which  requestors, notwithstanding the\n\nstatutory    bar,    might    nonetheless   receive    materials.\n\nSpecifically, the CIA must search such files and produce relevant\n\ninformation if a document request is\n\n          (1) [from] United States citizens . . . \n          who have requested information on themselves\n          . . . ; [or]\n\n          (2)  [regarding]  any  special  activity  the\n          existence  of   which  is  not   exempt  from\n          disclosure under [FOIA]; [or]\n\n          (3)  the   specific  subject  matter   of  an\n          investigation by  the intelligence committees\n          of the Congress,  the Intelligence  Oversight\n          Board, the Department  of Justice, the Office\n          of  General Counsel of  the [CIA], the Office\n          of  Inspector General  of the  [CIA], or  the\n          Office   of   the    Director   of    Central\n          Intelligence   for    any   impropriety,   or\n          violation   of   law,  Executive   order,  or\n          Presidential directive, in the conduct of any\n          intelligence activity.\n\n50 U.S.C.   431(c).   In sum, then, the  statutory exceptions are\n\nfor first-party requests, special activity requests, and requests\n\nthat focus on  investigations of  improprieties in  intelligence-\n\ngathering activities.\n\n                   B.  Applying the Exceptions.\n                                              \n\n          Although appellant asserts that her information request\n\nimplicates each  of the three  exceptions quoted above,  we think\n\nnone of them apply in this case.  We explain briefly.\n\n          1.   First-Party Requests.  Restricting  this aspect of\n          1.   First-Party Requests.\n                                   \n\nher  appeal to the information she solicits about her father, Ms.\n\nSullivan  asseverates that  the CIA  must search  its operational\n\nfiles   for  responsive  documents   because  section  431(c)(1),\n\n                                5\n\nproperly interpreted, requires the agency, on request, to produce\n\ninformation about the requestor's next-of-kin.  We disagree. \n\n          Appellant arrives at her  rather curious reading of the\n\nstatute  by a two-step pavane.  She says, first, that the statute\n\nis  vague as  to  rights of  next-of-kin;  and second,  that  the\n\nlegislative history  resolves the uncertainty  in her favor.   We\n\nfind  neither  step  to be  consistent  with  the  rhythm of  the\n\nInformation Act.\n\n          Section 431(c)(1) is anything but murky.  The statute's\n\nlanguage  limits the exclusion to  \"United States citizens  . . .\n\nwho  have requested  information  on themselves.\"    50 U.S.C.   \n\n431(c)(1).   While appellant suggests that,  in context, the word\n\n\"themselves\"  is  ambiguous, we  are  confident  that the  word's\n\ncommon meaning   \"those identical ones that  are they,\" Webster's\n                                                                 \n\nThird New  International Dictionary  2370 (1986)     is not  only\n                                   \n\npalpably plain  but is also anathematic  to appellant's rendition\n\nof  the exception.  The lack of ambiguity entirely undermines Ms.\n\nSullivan's  position.   Courts  will only  look behind  statutory\n\nlanguage in the rare case where a literal reading must be shunned\n\nbecause it  would produce  an absurd  outcome, see,  e.g., Public\n                                                                 \n\nCitizen v.

Here, reading the statute literally produces a perfectly\n\nplausible result  and the  clarity of  the  statutory command  is\n\nstunning.   That  ends the  matter:   if  Congress had  wished to\n\ncreate a right for next-of-kin, it could   and, we think, would  \n\nhave done so explicitly.\n\n          The second step of appellant's section 431(c)(1) pavane\n\nis equally bollixed.  The  legislative history of the Information\n\nAct  reinforces  rather  than  weakens  the  unrelievedly  narrow\n\nconstruction  of  the first-party  exception  that the  statutory\n\nlanguage portends.   See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 305, at 17-18.  While\n                              \n\nsome members of Congress  apparently believed that the CIA  would\n\ntreat  next-of-kin   requests  \"generously,\"  id.  at   18,  such\n                                                 \n\ngenerosity was  obviously meant to  be a  matter of  grace.   The\n\nSenate Report  states unequivocally:  \"This  legislation does not\n\ngive next-of-kin a right to request information about a  deceased\n\nperson.\"   Id. at 17.  The  predictions of individual senators to\n              \n\nthe  effect that an agency, once empowered, will act with greater\n\ngenerosity  than  it  is  obliged  to  exhibit  cannot  serve  to\n\noverwhelm the letter of the law.\n\n          We  have said  enough.   Neither  the  text of  section\n\n431(c)(1) nor its legislative  history support a right  of access\n\nto  CIA operational  files  for next-of-kin  requestors.   Hence,\n\n                                7\n\nappellant cannot wield  the first-party exception  as a wedge  to\n\nloosen the restrictions that safeguard CIA operational files.\n\n          2.  Special Activity  Requests.  Appellant's next claim\n          2.  Special Activity  Requests.\n                                        \n\nis  that the CIA must  produce the information  she seeks because\n\nher request relates to a \"special activity\" within the purview of\n\n50  U.S.C.   431(c)(2).  In this instance, the statute's language\n\nprovides relatively  scant guidance, other than  to mandate that,\n\nin  addition to having  a special activity  linkage, the material\n\nmust not otherwise be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.  See id.\n                                                                 \n\nThe statute is silent in a critical respect; neither its text nor\n\nits   structure   afford   a   meaningful   insight   into   what\n\ncharacteristics  of a CIA activity  make it \"special.\"   We turn,\n\ntherefore,  to the  legislative  history.   See, e.g.,  Greenwood\n                                                                 \n\nTrust Co. v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).\n\n          House  and  Senate  reports  make  clear that  Congress\n\ndesigned the special activity exception to allow public access to\n\ndeclassified information while still permitting the CIA to refuse\n\nto  confirm  or  deny  the  existence  of  documents relating  to\n\nclassified covert operations.  See H.R. Rep. No. 726, 98th Cong.,\n                                  \n\n2d Sess. 27 (1984); S. Rep. No. 305, at 24.  To accommodate these\n\ncompeting  objectives,  the special  activity  provision  must be\n\nconstrued  in  light  of two  basic  concerns:   specificity  and\n\nsecrecy.\n\n                                8\n\n          As to the specificity  prong, a requestor must identify\n\na  particular CIA activity in connection with his or her request.\n             \n\nThe  House report accompanying the Information  Act tells us that\n\nthe term \"special activity\"\n\n          means  any  activity  of  the  United  States\n          Government, other than  an activity  intended\n          solely for  obtaining necessary intelligence,\n          which  is  planned and  executed so  that the\n          role of the United  States is not apparent or\n          acknowledged   publicly,  and   functions  in\n          support   of  any  such   activity,  but  not\n          including diplomatic activities.\n\nH.R.  Rep. No.  726, at  28.   The Senate  added content  to this\n\nexplanation by  furnishing examples.  Thus,  requests must relate\n\nto  \"a specific covert action operation,  such as the Bay of Pigs\n\ninvasion or the CIA's role in replacement of the Guatemala regime\n\nin the 1950s . . . .\"  S. Rep. No. 305, at 24-25.  By contrast, a\n\nrequest  is  insufficiently specific  \"if  it refers  to  a broad\n\ncategory or type of covert action operations.\"  Id. at 25.  As an\n                                                   \n\nexample of  an inadequately  particularized  request, the  Senate\n\nreport mentions  one that  is \"predicated on  declassification of\n\nthe existence of CIA covert  efforts to counter Soviet  influence\n\nin Western Europe during the 1950s . . . .\"  Id.\n                                                \n\n          Appellant  argues  on appeal  that the  information she\n\nseeks is part and parcel of a particular \"special activity\":  the\n\nCIA's  unremitting efforts  to  overthrow Cuban  President  Fidel\n\nCastro.  Although the  parties dispute whether appellant espoused\n\nthis  theory before the district  court, we need  not resolve the\n\nquestion  of  waiver because  it is  apparent  that, even  in its\n\npresent incarnation, appellant's theory  is unavailing:  it rests\n\n                                9\n\non  CIA activity that is too expansively described to slip within\n\nthe integument of section 431(c)(2).\n\n          In an effort to prove the contrary, appellant seizes on\n\nan example limned  in the  Senate report and  proclaims that  the\n\ncoup deposing  Guatemalan  President Arbenz  in  1954 is  a  fair\n\ncongener to the  special activity  she has described.   We  think\n\nnot.   While equating the two might produce a certain superficial\n\nsymmetry, doing  so flies in the  teeth of history.   There is an\n\nessential  difference in  the magnitude  and scope  of the  anti-\n\nArbenz  and anti-Castro  campaigns.   President  Arbenz fled  his\n\ncountry at the conclusion of a CIA-inspired operation that lasted\n\nonly a  few months and  involved only a  handful of agents.   See\n                                                                 \n\nJeremiah O'Leary, Tricks of the Coup Trade, Wash. Times, Dec. 19,\n                                          \n\n1989,  at F3;  see generally  Julius Pratt,  A History  of United\n                                                                 \n\nStates Foreign Policy 532-33  (1965).  Like the Bay  of Pigs, the\n                     \n\noverthrow of  the Guatemalan government was  a discrete operation\n\nwith  a  beginning,  an end,  and  a  circumscribed  middle.   In\n\ncontrast, the CIA's campaign against  Castro has been ongoing for\n\ndecades.  By all accounts, it has involved widespread efforts and\n\nhordes of people.  Indeed, the CIA's role in respect  to Castro's\n\nCuba is more properly analogous to CIA operations  against Soviet\n\ninfluence in Western Europe during the 1950s, a course of conduct\n\nwhich  the  Senate specifically  indicated  was  too sweeping  to\n\ntrigger  the special  activity  exception, than  to  the coup  in\n\nGuatemala.\n\n          We turn now to the second prong:  secrecy.  The special\n\n                                10\n\nactivity provision also requires  that the requested material not\n\nbe exempt from disclosure  under FOIA.  At  the very least,  this\n\nmeans that the data must be either unclassified  or declassified.\n\nSee  5 U.S.C.     552(b)(1)(B) (establishing  FOIA exemption  for\n   \n\nclassified  materials).

The mere fact that the CIA acknowledges\n\ninvolvement in  an  incident or,  more broadly,  in a  particular\n\nregion  of the world, does  not justify the  release of documents\n\nwhich touch, however distantly, on that incident or region.\n\n          Of  course, certain  aspects  of the  CIA's efforts  to\n\ndestabilize the Castro regime  are in the public domain  (the Bay\n\nof Pigs, for one).  Nonetheless appellant's initial FOIA  request\n\napparently  did not  seek  information related  to the  subjects'\n\nparticipation  in any  specific  (declassified) operations,3  but\n\nsimply inquired about  the two men    whose  alleged role in  CIA\n\naffairs  has never  been acknowledged  by either  the CIA  or any\n\n                    \n\n     3We are  frank to acknowledge  that the appellate  record is\nnot entirely pellucid in  this regard.

Investigatory  Requests.\n                                     \n\nthe notion  that because  a Senate  Select Committee  (the Church\n\nCommittee) inquired  into certain covert  operations against Cuba\n\nmounted by the CIA and other (putatively independent) anti-Castro\n\ngroups,4  the information  she requests  comprises  \"the specific\n\nsubject  matter   of  an   investigation  by   [an]  intelligence\n\ncommittee[]  of  the  Congress .  .  .  for  any impropriety,  or\n\n                    \n\n     4The Church Committee eventually filed a  compendious report\nof its investigation.  See The Investigation of the Assassination\n                                                                 \nof  President John F.

In our view, appellant's FOIA\n\nrequest does not fall within the exception's province.\n\n          As the statute's language and legislative  history make\n\nclear,  see  id.;  see  also  H.R. Rep.  No.  726,  at  28-31,  a\n                            \n\ncongressional  investigation that  touches  on CIA  conduct in  a\n\nparticular incident or region,  standing alone, is not sufficient\n\nto warrant the release  of all CIA documents anent  that incident\n\nor  region.   Instead,  the congressional  investigation and  the\n\ndocuments sought must specifically relate to CIA wrongdoing, that\n\nis,  some \"impropriety\" or \"violation  of law\" in  the conduct of\n\nthe  designated intelligence  activity.   50 U.S.C.    431(c)(3).\n\nThe primary mission of the Church Committee, as appellant admits,\n\nwas   to  examine   the   relationship,  if   any,  between   the\n\nassassination  of  President  Kennedy,   on  the  one  hand,  and\n\nAmerican-sponsored operations  against Cuba, on the  second hand.\n\nIn  the course  of its  work,  the Committee  considered American\n\noperations against Castro and,  inevitably, their legality.  Seen\n\nfrom  that  perspective, the  Committee's  mission  does not  fit\n\nwithin the contours of section 431(c)(3) for two reasons.  First,\n\nthe  Committee's inquiry was not a  direct investigation into CIA\n\nwrongdoing.   Second, appellant's  request for  information about\n\nher   father's  disappearance   bears  no   claimed  or   readily\n\ndiscernible relationship to  the investigation's purposes.   This\n\nlatter  obstacle is  insurmountable:   a  pivotal requirement  of\n\nsection  431(c)(3) is  that, to  be extractable,  the information\n\n                                13\n\nrequested  must  concern  the  specific  subject  matter  of  the\n\nofficial investigation.   Thus, although there  were instances in\n\nwhich  the  Committee   searched  for  agency  misconduct,   that\n\nhappenstance does  not allow  appellant to catapult  herself over\n\nthe  statutory parapet.  It is simply not enough that information\n\nwhich bore  in some remote  way on  the request  surfaced in  the\n\ncourse of an official investigation.   See H.R. Rep. No.  726, at\n                                          \n\n30-31.\n\n          Appellant   also   points  hopefully,   albeit  without\n\ndeveloped  argumentation,  to  the   work  of  the  House  Select\n\nCommittee  on  Assassinations  (HSCA).    This  committee  probed\n\nwhether  the  CIA might  have  played  a  role in  the  death  of\n\nPresident Kennedy, see H.R.  Rep. No. 1828, 95th Cong.,  2d Sess.\n                      \n\n(1979), concluding that it did not.  Id. at 3.  Assuming arguendo\n                                                                 \n\nthat the HSCA investigation centered on potential CIA wrongdoing,\n\nits work still cannot serve as a vehicle for bringing appellant's\n\nrequest within the statutory exception.  Appellant is not seeking\n\ninformation on  the CIA's role  in the Kennedy  assassination and\n\nhas  not alleged  that either  her father  or Rorke  was directly\n\ninvolved in  any such machinations.   Hence, because  her request\n\ndoes  not   overlap  the   \"specific  subject  matter   of  [the]\n\ninvestigation,\" 50 U.S.C.    431(c)(3), she  cannot use the  HSCA\n\nreport as a  means to  escape the strictures  of the  Information\n\nAct.\n\n          We rule, therefore, that neither the Church Committee's\n\ninvestigation nor HSCA's probe is sufficiently sturdy a bootstrap\n\n                                14\n\nto  lift appellant's FOIA request over the hurdles erected by the\n\ncongressional investigation exception to the Information Act.5\n\nIII.  THE JFK ACT CLAIM\n\n          After the district court entered summary  judgment, but\n\nbefore  appellant briefed  this appeal,  Congress passed  the JFK\n\nAct,  Pub. L.  No.  102-526, 106  Stat.  3443  (1992).   The  Act\n\nrequires    that   records   related   to   President   Kennedy's\n\nassassination be transferred to  the National Archives where they\n\nare to be made publicly  available, subject to certain stipulated\n\nconditions.   Id.   5.   The Act constructs a  process   distinct\n                 \n\nfrom FOIA    by which the public can search those documents in an\n\nalmost unfettered  fashion.  See id.    4.  In  a peroration that\n                                    \n\nsheds considerably  more heat  than  light, appellant  insinuates\n\nthat her father's disappearance might  be tied in some  undefined\n\nway  to President  Kennedy's assassination  and implores  that we\n\norder the district court to review  her information request under\n\nthe new  law's disclosure  provisions.  Her  argument is  policy-\n\ndriven; in her view, federal courts should go to great lengths to\n\norder documents produced  under the JFK  Act because the  statute\n\ninstructs agencies to \"give priority to . . . the identification,\n\nreview, and transmission, under the standards of postponement set\n\nforth in this Act,  of assassination records that on the  date of\n\nenactment  of  this  Act  are  the  subject of  litigation  under\n\n                    \n\n     5Having  disposed of appellant's  initiative on this ground,\nwe  need not consider whether either the Church Committee or HSCA\nwas an  \"intelligence committee[]\" within the  meaning of section\n431(c)(3).\n\n                                15\n\n[FOIA].\"  See id.   5(c)(2)(G).\n                 \n\n          We are  unconvinced.  The  JFK Act, like  FOIA, assigns\n\nprimary responsibility for assessing information  requests to the\n\nExecutive Branch.   Judicial review is merely a safeguard against\n\nagency action  that proves arbitrary, capricious,  or contrary to\n\nlaw, not  an option  of first  resort.  We  can discern  no valid\n\nreason  to  throw  caution  to  the winds,  disrupt  the  orderly\n\nworkings of the statutory scheme, and instruct the district court\n\nto  dive headlong  into  uncharted waters.    Doing so  would  be\n\npremature from  virtually every  standpoint:  the  compilation of\n\nrecords required by the JFK Act has not been completed, appellant\n\nhas not  invoked the administrative processes  afforded under the\n\nlegislation,  no agency action has  been taken thereunder, and, a\n                                                                 \n\nfortiori,  there is no administrative record for a court to mull.\n        \n\nSee  Assassination Archives  &amp;  Research Ctr.  v.  U.S. Dep't  of\n                                                                 \n\nJustice,      F. Supp.      ,     n.3 (D.D.C. 1993) [No. 92-2193;\n                                 \n\nslip op. at 12 n.3] (finding similar JFK Act claim unripe).\n\n          We  need go no further.  Appellant has boldly grafted a\n\nneoteric JFK Act claim  that belongs before the Archivist  of the\n\nUnited States onto  her FOIA appeal.   Since there  is no  agency\n\naction   for  the  district  court  to   review,  we  decline  to\n\nparticipate in so  radical an experiment.   See JFK Act,    11(c)\n                                               \n\n(providing  for  judicial  review  of \"final  actions\"  taken  by\n\nagencies).\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          Although we sympathize with appellant's desire to learn\n\n                                16\n\nthe  details of her father's fate, she, like all other litigants,\n\nmust  abide by the rules.   Congress crafted  the CIA Information\n\nAct  to  strike  a  balance  between  public  disclosure  and  an\n\neffective intelligence apparatus.   Our role  is not to  reassess\n\nthe relative  interests, see Sims, 471  U.S. at 180, or  to yield\n                                 \n\nwhenever human  sympathies are engaged,  but simply to  apply the\n\nlaw  as Congress wrote it.   Given the  generality of appellant's\n\nrequest and  the stringent standard of  confidentiality contained\n\nin the Information Act,  the district court appropriately granted\n\nsummary  judgment in the government's favor.  Further, as we have\n\nexplained,  the   freshly  minted  JFK  Act   claim  provides  no\n\nprincipled basis for  a remand  and, thus, no  detour around  the\n\nruling below.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                17\n</pre>",
