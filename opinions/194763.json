Andrew   and  Priscilla  Tempelman  (the\n                \n\ntaxpayers) filed a  pro se action  in federal district  court\n\nseeking  to enjoin  the Internal  Revenue Service  (IRS) from\n\ncollecting back  taxes.    The  lower  court  denied  relief,\n\nconcluding that the  suit was barred  by the  Anti-Injunction\n\nAct, 26 U.S.C.    7421(a).  We agree with  this determination\n\nand therefore affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     The taxpayers own and operate a small inn and restaurant\n\nin Milford, New Hampshire.  In 1990, the IRS served them with\n\nnotices of deficiency pursuant  to 26 U.S.C.    6212 claiming\n\nthat approximately $130,000 in taxes, interest and  penalties\n\nwere  owed for  the  years 1984  and  1985.1   The  taxpayers\n\nthereafter filed a timely petition under 26 U.S.C.   6213 for\n\nredetermination  in  tax court.    On  October 4,  1991,  the\n\ntaxpayers  and the IRS presented the  court with a stipulated\n\nagreement calculating a  total liability for  those years  of\n\napproximately  $35,000 plus  interest.   The tax  court judge\n\nadopted this agreement in a decision dated November 27, 1991.\n\nThe taxpayers filed an  appeal from this decision on  May 20,\n\n1992, claiming inter alia  that they had been coerced  by the\n                         \n\nIRS  and the tax court into signing the stipulation.  Because\n\ntheir  notice of appeal was filed well past the 90-day period\n\nprescribed  by Fed. R. App. P. 13(a), we dismissed the appeal\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction on September 1, 1992.  We thereafter\n\n                    \n\n1.  While  the IRS  also alleged  deficiencies for  the years\n1983 and 1986-88, the instant case pertains only to the years\n1984-85.  \n\ndenied their motion for reconsideration and for permission to\n\nfile late.\n\n     Under 26  U.S.C.   6213(a),  the IRS is  prohibited from\n\nmaking   any  assessment  or  levy  or  otherwise  initiating\n\ncollection efforts until  the decision of the  tax court \"has\n\nbecome final\"--which  in this  case occurred on  February 25,\n\n1992.  See  26 U.S.C.   7481(a).   In the stipulated decision\n          \n\nadopted by  the tax  court, however, the  taxpayers expressly\n\nagreed to  waive this restriction.   Accordingly, in December\n\n1991,  the  IRS made  assessments  for the  years  1984-85 in\n\naccordance with  that decision.   Upon taxpayers'  failure to\n\npay, the IRS in  August 1992 levied upon their  New Hampshire\n\nbank account and  filed a  notice of tax  lien against  their\n\nproperty.  Taxpayers responded  by filing their complaint for\n\ninjunctive relief.\n\n                             II.\n\n     The   Anti-Injunction   Act   provides,   with   certain\n\nenumerated  exceptions,  that \"no  suit  for  the purpose  of\n\nrestraining the assessment or collection of  any tax shall be\n\nmaintained  in any court  by any  person ....\"   26  U.S.C.  \n\n7421(a).    In Enochs  v. Williams  Packing  Co., 370  U.S. 1\n                                                \n\n(1962), the  Court fashioned an additional  exception to this\n\nprovision, holding that a suit  for injunctive relief may lie\n\nwhere (1) the taxpayer will suffer irreparable harm absent an\n\ninjunction, and (2)  it is clear that \"under no circumstances\n\n                             -3-\n\ncould the Government  ultimately prevail\"  on the  underlying\n\ndispute.   Id. at 7;  accord, e.g., South  Carolina v. Regan,\n                                                            \n\n465 U.S. 367,  374 (1984); Commissioner v.  Shapiro, 424 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n614, 627 (1976); Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U.S.  725, 737\n                                         \n\n(1974);  Lane v. United States,  727 F.2d 18,  20 (1st Cir.),\n                              \n\ncert. denied, 469 U.S.  829 (1984).  The taxpayers  here seek\n            \n\nto  invoke this exception, arguing  that they satisfy both of\n\nthe  Enochs  criteria.    The district  court  (adopting  the\n           \n\nrecommendations  of  a  magistrate-judge) disagreed,  finding\n\nthat the  taxpayers had established irreparable  harm but had\n\nfailed   to  show   that  the   government  would   under  no\n\ncircumstances  prevail.     This  determination   is  plainly\n\ncorrect.       The  Enochs Court  elaborated  on  the  latter\n                          \n\nrequirement as follows:\n\n          [T]he question of whether the Government has a\n     chance of ultimately prevailing is to be determined\n     on the basis  of the information available to it at\n     the  time of  suit.   Only if  it is  then apparent\n     that,  under the most  liberal view of  the law and\n     facts,  the  United  States  cannot  establish  its\n     claim,  may   the  suit   for   an  injunction   be\n     maintained.\n\n370 U.S.  at 7.  In  attempting to meet this  \"heavy\" burden,\n\nMcCarthy v. Marshall,  723 F.2d 1034,  1040 (1st Cir.  1983),\n                    \n\nthe taxpayers advance two arguments.  First, they charge that\n\nthey were coerced into  signing the stipulation, under threat\n\nof  dismissal  of  their  petition, without  having  had  the\n\nopportunity  to  examine  the agreement  and  the  underlying\n\ntabulations.   The  transcripts of  the tax  court proceeding\n\n                             -4-\n\nundermine  this  claim.2   They  reveal  that  the threat  of\n\ndismissal  arose--not because of  any heavy-handed tactics on\n\nthe  part of  the  IRS  or  the  court--but  because  of  the\n\ntaxpayers'  inadequate bookkeeping and their unwillingness to\n\nproduce records.  Indeed, the court refrained from dismissing\n\nthe petition even while noting that the IRS was \"entitled\" to\n\nsuch  relief.  Supp. App.  at 52.   Furthermore, although the\n\ntaxpayers  appeared pro se, the court arranged for them to be\n\nassisted by an attorney from a local law school's tax clinic,\n\nwho  argued on their behalf.  At  the close of the hearing at\n\nwhich the agreement was  announced, the taxpayers praised the\n\njudge.  Id. at 42.  After the judge's decision, the taxpayers\n           \n\nnever  filed  a motion  for  reconsideration or  a  motion to\n\nvacate or revise.  See  Tax Court Rules 161, 162.   Any claim\n                      \n\nof coercion or duress is, at the very least, far-fetched.\n\n     Second, the taxpayers complain  that, once the tax court\n\ndecision  issued, the  IRS  attorney destroyed  her  personal\n\nworking  papers containing  the  calculations underlying  the\n\nstipulated agreement.  They contend that  she was required to\n\nretain  those  papers until  the  tax  court decision  became\n\n                    \n\n2.  Because the district court  dismissed the complaint prior\nto service  of process  on the government,  these transcripts\nwere not part of the record below.  The IRS, having submitted\nthem in a supplemental  appendix to this court, asks  that we\ntake judicial notice thereof.  This request is granted.  See,\n                                                            \ne.g., Fed. R. Evid.  201; Taino Lines, Inc. v.  M/V Constance\n                                                             \nPan Atlantic, 982  F.2d 20,  22 n.8 (1st  Cir. 1992);  United\n                                                             \nStates v. Berzon, 941 F.2d 8, 14 n.9 (1st Cir. 1991). \n                \n\n                             -5-\n\nfinal.   They  argue  that the  attorney's calculations  were\n\nriddled with errors  and omissions.  And they  conclude that,\n\nsince all \"evidence\"  in support  of the IRS'  claim has  now\n\nbeen destroyed, the IRS has no chance of prevailing  thereon.\n\n     This line  of reasoning is  likewise unavailing.   It is\n\nhardly  surprising  that  personal working  papers  would  be\n\ndisposed of once a stipulated agreement has  been reached and\n\nentered.   Such papers are obviously not the central evidence\n\nin support  of the IRS' claim  that back taxes are  due.  And\n\nthe  taxpayers' underlying complaint  of IRS miscalculations,\n\nhaving  not   been  timely   raised,  falls  well   short  of\n\nestablishing   \"that   under  no   circumstances   could  the\n\nGovernment ultimately prevail.\"   We therefore agree with the\n\nlower court that the Enochs exception is inapplicable.3\n                           \n\n     The  taxpayers' remaining arguments  can be more readily\n\ndismissed.  First, they seek,  in the alternative, to  invoke\n\none of  the statutory exceptions to  the Anti-Injunction Act:\n\nthe provision in    6213(a) permitting a court to  enjoin any\n\nassessment made  prior to  the tax court's  decision becoming\n\nfinal.    As mentioned,  however,  the  taxpayers waived  the\n\nstatutory bar  on assessments being made prior  to that time.\n\n                    \n\n3.  Indeed,  in light of the dismissal of the appeal from the\ntax court ruling, it might well be argued that the government\nalready has prevailed.  We need not decide,  however, whether\nthe  instant  matter is  moot or  is  barred on  res judicata\n                                                             \ngrounds, inasmuch as it is in any event without merit.\n\n                             -6-\n\nMoreover, the filing of  a notice of appeal operates  to stay\n\nthe assessment or collection  of a deficiency only if  a bond\n\nis filed  with the tax court.   See 26 U.S.C.    7485(a); Tax\n                                   \n\nCourt Rule 192.  No such bond was filed here.  \n\n     Second, the taxpayers complain  that the district  court\n\ndismissed  their suit sua sponte prior  to service of process\n                                \n\non the government.   Yet  the court's lack  of authority  was\n\napparent  from the face  of the  complaint.   The magistrate-\n\njudge's  report  provided  ample  notice  of the  complaint's\n\ndeficiencies.     And   the   taxpayers  were   afforded  two\n\nopportunities   to  correct  those   shortcomings:  first  in\n\nobjecting  to  the  magistrate-judge's report,  and  later in\n\nasking  the  district court  to  reconsider  its judgment  of\n\ndismissal (the  court, in  fact, granted  reconsideration and\n\nthen  reinstated its  dismissal).   We  thus need  not decide\n\nwhether  the court's sua sponte dismissal was error.  Even if\n                               \n\nit were, any such error was, under the circumstances, plainly\n\nharmless.  See, e.g.,  Purvis v. Ponte, 929 F.2d  822, 826-27\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).4\n\n                    \n\n4.  The taxpayers  also rely  on the Shapiro  Court's holding\n                                            \nthat, before the applicability of the Enochs exception can be\n                                            \nascertained,  the government  has the obligation  to disclose\nthe factual basis for  its assessments.  See 424 U.S. at 626-\n                                            \n27.   That holding is  clearly inapposite.   The Shapiro case\n                                                        \ninvolved  a jeopardy assessment  made without any opportunity\nfor a prompt post-seizure inquiry into the basis for the IRS'\nclaim.   Here,  by contrast,  the taxpayers  have had  a full\nopportunity to contest the IRS' claim in tax court. \n\n                             -7-\n\n     Affirmed.  The motion  to amend pleading and  the motion\n                                                             \n\nto show cause are denied. \n                         \n\n                             -8-\n",

While  the IRS  also alleged  deficiencies for  the years\n1983 and 1986-88, the instant case pertains only to the years\n1984-85.  \n\ndenied their motion for reconsideration and for permission to\n\nfile late.\n\n     Under 26  U.S.C.   6213(a),  the IRS is  prohibited from\n\nmaking   any  assessment  or  levy  or  otherwise  initiating\n\ncollection efforts until  the decision of the  tax court \"has\n\nbecome final\"--which  in this  case occurred on  February 25,\n\n1992.  See  26 U.S.C.   7481(a).   In the stipulated decision\n          \n\nadopted by  the tax  court, however, the  taxpayers expressly\n\nagreed to  waive this restriction.   Accordingly, in December\n\n1991,  the  IRS made  assessments  for the  years  1984-85 in\n\naccordance with  that decision.   Upon taxpayers'  failure to\n\npay, the IRS in  August 1992 levied upon their  New Hampshire\n\nbank account and  filed a  notice of tax  lien against  their\n\nproperty.  Taxpayers responded  by filing their complaint for\n\ninjunctive relief.\n\n                             II.\n\n     The   Anti-Injunction   Act   provides,   with   certain\n\nenumerated  exceptions,  that \"no  suit  for  the purpose  of\n\nrestraining the assessment or collection of  any tax shall be\n\nmaintained  in any court  by any  person ....\"   26  U.S.C.  \n\n7421(a).

The taxpayers  here seek\n            \n\nto  invoke this exception, arguing  that they satisfy both of\n\nthe  Enochs  criteria.    The district  court  (adopting  the\n           \n\nrecommendations  of  a  magistrate-judge) disagreed,  finding\n\nthat the  taxpayers had established irreparable  harm but had\n\nfailed   to  show   that  the   government  would   under  no\n\ncircumstances  prevail.     This  determination   is  plainly\n\ncorrect.       The  Enochs Court  elaborated  on  the  latter\n                          \n\nrequirement as follows:\n\n          [T]he question of whether the Government has a\n     chance of ultimately prevailing is to be determined\n     on the basis  of the information available to it at\n     the  time of  suit.   Only if  it is  then apparent\n     that,  under the most  liberal view of  the law and\n     facts,  the  United  States  cannot  establish  its\n     claim,  may   the  suit   for   an  injunction   be\n     maintained.\n\n370 U.S.  at 7.  In  attempting to meet this  \"heavy\" burden,\n\nMcCarthy v. Marshall,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429194\"><a href=\"/opinion/429194/william-j-mccarthy-v-f-ray-marshall-secretary-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1040 (1st Cir.  1983),\n                    \n\nthe taxpayers advance two arguments.  First, they charge that\n\nthey were coerced into  signing the stipulation, under threat\n\nof  dismissal  of  their  petition, without  having  had  the\n\nopportunity  to  examine  the agreement  and  the  underlying\n\ntabulations.   The  transcripts of  the tax  court proceeding\n\n                             -4-\n\nundermine  this  claim.2   They  reveal  that  the threat  of\n\ndismissal  arose--not because of  any heavy-handed tactics on\n\nthe  part of  the  IRS  or  the  court--but  because  of  the\n\ntaxpayers'  inadequate bookkeeping and their unwillingness to\n\nproduce records.  Indeed, the court refrained from dismissing\n\nthe petition even while noting that the IRS was \"entitled\" to\n\nsuch  relief.  Supp. App.  at 52.   Furthermore, although the\n\ntaxpayers  appeared pro se, the court arranged for them to be\n\nassisted by an attorney from a local law school's tax clinic,\n\nwho  argued on their behalf.  At  the close of the hearing at\n\nwhich the agreement was  announced, the taxpayers praised the\n\njudge.  Id. at 42.  After the judge's decision, the taxpayers\n           \n\nnever  filed  a motion  for  reconsideration or  a  motion to\n\nvacate or revise.  See  Tax Court Rules 161, 162.   Any claim\n                      \n\nof coercion or duress is, at the very least, far-fetched.\n\n     Second, the taxpayers complain  that, once the tax court\n\ndecision  issued, the  IRS  attorney destroyed  her  personal\n\nworking  papers containing  the  calculations underlying  the\n\nstipulated agreement.  They contend that  she was required to\n\nretain  those  papers until  the  tax  court decision  became\n\n                    \n\n2.  Because the district court  dismissed the complaint prior\nto service  of process  on the government,  these transcripts\nwere not part of the record below.  The IRS, having submitted\nthem in a supplemental  appendix to this court, asks  that we\ntake judicial notice thereof.  This request is granted.

They  argue  that the  attorney's calculations  were\n\nriddled with errors  and omissions.  And they  conclude that,\n\nsince all \"evidence\"  in support  of the IRS'  claim has  now\n\nbeen destroyed, the IRS has no chance of prevailing  thereon.\n\n     This line  of reasoning is  likewise unavailing.   It is\n\nhardly  surprising  that  personal working  papers  would  be\n\ndisposed of once a stipulated agreement has  been reached and\n\nentered.   Such papers are obviously not the central evidence\n\nin support  of the IRS' claim  that back taxes are  due.  And\n\nthe  taxpayers' underlying complaint  of IRS miscalculations,\n\nhaving  not   been  timely   raised,  falls  well   short  of\n\nestablishing   \"that   under  no   circumstances   could  the\n\nGovernment ultimately prevail.\"   We therefore agree with the\n\nlower court that the Enochs exception is inapplicable.3\n                           \n\n     The  taxpayers' remaining arguments  can be more readily\n\ndismissed.  First, they seek,  in the alternative, to  invoke\n\none of  the statutory exceptions to  the Anti-Injunction Act:\n\nthe provision in    6213(a) permitting a court to  enjoin any\n\nassessment made  prior to  the tax court's  decision becoming\n\nfinal.    As mentioned,  however,  the  taxpayers waived  the\n\nstatutory bar  on assessments being made prior  to that time.\n\n                    \n\n3.  Indeed,  in light of the dismissal of the appeal from the\ntax court ruling, it might well be argued that the government\nalready has prevailed.  We need not decide,  however, whether\nthe  instant  matter is  moot or  is  barred on  res judicata\n                                                             \ngrounds, inasmuch as it is in any event without merit.\n\n                             -6-\n\nMoreover, the filing of  a notice of appeal operates  to stay\n\nthe assessment or collection  of a deficiency only if  a bond\n\nis filed  with the tax court.   See 26 U.S.C.    7485(a); Tax\n                                   \n\nCourt Rule 192.  No such bond was filed here.  \n\n     Second, the taxpayers complain  that the district  court\n\ndismissed  their suit sua sponte prior  to service of process\n                                \n\non the government.   Yet  the court's lack  of authority  was\n\napparent  from the face  of the  complaint.   The magistrate-\n\njudge's  report  provided  ample  notice  of the  complaint's\n\ndeficiencies.     And   the   taxpayers  were   afforded  two\n\nopportunities   to  correct  those   shortcomings:  first  in\n\nobjecting  to  the  magistrate-judge's report,  and  later in\n\nasking  the  district court  to  reconsider  its judgment  of\n\ndismissal (the  court, in  fact, granted  reconsideration and\n\nthen  reinstated its  dismissal).   We  thus need  not decide\n\nwhether  the court's sua sponte dismissal was error.  Even if\n                               \n\nit were, any such error was, under the circumstances, plainly\n\nharmless.  See, e.g.,  Purvis v. Ponte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558571\"><a href=\"/opinion/558571/kevin-c-purvis-v-joseph-ponte/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 826-27\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).4\n\n                    \n\n4.  The taxpayers  also rely  on the Shapiro  Court's holding\n                                            \nthat, before the applicability of the Enochs exception can be\n                                            \nascertained,  the government  has the obligation  to disclose\nthe factual basis for  its assessments.  See 424 U.S. at 626-\n                                            \n27.   That holding is  clearly inapposite.   The Shapiro case\n                                                        \ninvolved  a jeopardy assessment  made without any opportunity\nfor a prompt post-seizure inquiry into the basis for the IRS'\nclaim.
