In this  appeal plaintiff\n                                \n\nseeks  the proceeds of a  certificate of deposit  issued by a\n\nnow-failed  bank.    Simultaneously  with  its  purchase, the\n\ncertificate  was assigned  to  a third  party, the  Insurance\n\nCommissioner  of the  Commonwealth   of   Puerto   Rico (\"the\n\nCommissioner\").   The Commissioner  brought suit  against the\n\nFDIC  seeking to establish his  right to the  proceeds of the\n\ncertificate, and attempted to introduce  documents evidencing\n\nboth  the assignment and  the bank's  acknowledgment thereof.\n\nThe district court  applied 12  U.S.C.   1823(e)  to bar  the\n\nassignee's  use of  the assignment  documents.   Finding both\n\nsection 1823(e)  and the  D'Oench1 doctrine inapplicable,  we\n                                 \n\nreverse.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          The facts of this case are  essentially undisputed.\n\nIn order to  do business  in the commonwealth,   Puerto  Rico\n\ninsurance  companies are  first  required by  law to  deposit\n\nfunds with the  Commissioner.   See 26  L.P.R.A.     801-809.\n                                   \n\nMoreover,  once these  funds are  deposited, Puerto  Rico law\n\nprovides that they  may not  be levied upon  by creditors  or\n\n                    \n\n1.  As  we pointed out in  McCullough v. FDIC,  987 F.2d 870,\n                                             \n874  (1st Cir.  1993), section  1823(e) is  \"somewhat loosely\ndescribed as  the codification\" of the  D'Oench doctrine, and\n                                               \nthe parties' briefs in this case address both D'Oench and its\n                                                     \n\"statutory partner,\" id.  at 874  n.6.  Seeing  no reason  to\n                        \nexcept   D'Oench  from   our   discussion,  we   address  the\n                \napplication of both doctrines.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nclaimants  of the insurance company.  Id.   809 (\"No judgment\n                                         \n\ncreditor  or other claimant of an insurer shall levy upon any\n\ndeposit  held pursuant  to  this chapter,  or  upon any  part\n\nthereof.\").   On  July  20, 1983,  in  order to  satisfy  the\n\nstatutory   deposit   requirement,  Guaranty   Insurance  Co.\n\n(\"Guaranty\")  purchased a  six-month  certificate of  deposit\n\nfrom the Girod Trust  Company (\"Girod\" or \"the bank\")  in the\n\nprincipal amount of $50,000.  The certificate  of deposit had\n\na maturity date of January 17, 1984.  On the same day that it\n\npurchased  the  certificate,  Guaranty,  through  one  of its\n\nofficers,  executed a separate document entitled a \"Fiduciary\n\nAssignment\" in which it irrevocably assigned and conveyed its\n\ninterest in  the certificate of deposit  to the Commissioner.\n\nGirod was not a party to the Fiduciary Assignment.\n\n          Accompanying  both the  certificate of  deposit and\n\nthe Fiduciary Assignment was yet another document executed on\n\nthe  same date, July  20, 1983, entitled  \"Requisition to the\n\nBank.\" This Requisition stated,  inter alia, that Girod would\n                                           \n\nnot  release  the funds  represented  by  the certificate  of\n\ndeposit,  \"whether the  principal value  or income  thereof,\"\n\nwithout  the   authorization  of  the  Commissioner.     More\n\nspecifically, the Requisition stated, \"[W]e [Girod] agree and\n\npromise  to dispose of  the certificate of  deposit  .   .  .\n\nonly  with  prior  authorization  from  the  Commissioner  of\n\nInsurance of  Puerto Rico.\"   The  Requisition was signed  by\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nAllwin  Perez \"in  his capacity  as manager  of the  San Juan\n\nbranch of Girod Trust Company.\"  His signature was notarized.\n\nLike the Fiduciary Assignment, the Requisition stated,  \"This\n\nrequisition will be irrevocable.\"  The certificate of deposit\n\nitself was given to, and remains with, the Commissioner.\n\n          Less  than   three  months  after   purchasing  the\n\ncertificate of  deposit from Girod, Guaranty  executed a loan\n\nagreement, unrelated to the certificate  of deposit, pursuant\n\nto  which  it borrowed  $600,000 from  Girod.   The  loan was\n\nevidenced by a  promissory note for  that amount, payable  to\n\nGirod.   The note  was due  on April  26, 1984,  and Guaranty\n\nbegan  making payments  according  to  the  loan  agreement's\n\nschedule.\n\n          On  January 17,  1984, the  certificate of  deposit\n\ncame due.  At the request of Guaranty, it was  \"rolled over,\"\n\ni.e., extended for a term of  six additional months.  In  the\n\nmeantime, Guaranty had fallen behind on payments due to Girod\n\nunder the $600,000  loan agreement.   On July  16, 1984,  the\n\ncertificate of deposit came  due again.  This  time, however,\n\nthe certificate was not  \"rolled over.\"  Rather, on  July 18,\n\n1984,  two  days  after  the  certificate  had  matured,  the\n\nproceeds were credited to Guaranty's  account.  Specifically,\n\n$50,000 from the certificate of  deposit was  credited toward\n\nGuaranty's outstanding  indebtedness under the  $600,000 loan\n\nagreement.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          On August 16,  1984, Girod  was declared  insolvent\n\nand the  FDIC was appointed receiver.   On December 19, 1984,\n\nGuaranty  also  became  insolvent.    The  Commissioner   was\n\nappointed  Guaranty's  receiver.   On  August  25, 1986,  the\n\nCommissioner filed  a proof of  claim with the  FDIC, seeking\n\npayment  on the  certificate of  deposit.   On May  22, 1991,\n\nhaving  received no  payment on  the claim,  the Commissioner\n\nfiled a complaint against  the FDIC in the Superior  Court of\n\nPuerto  Rico   seeking  to   recover  the  proceeds   of  the\n\ncertificate  of  deposit.   The  FDIC removed  the  action to\n\nfederal court pursuant to 12 U.S.C.   1819(b).\n\n          The   parties   filed  cross-motions   for  summary\n\njudgment.2 Without ruling on  the motions, the district court\n\nasked the parties to  submit briefs on the application  of 12\n\nU.S.C.   1823(e).3 Upon submission of the briefs,the district\n\n                    \n\n2.  The Commissioner argued, in  essence, that the offset was\nimproper  and that  he was  entitled to  the proceeds  of the\ncertificate of  deposit.  The  FDIC argued, inter  alia, that\n                                                       \nthe Commissioner's claim was barred by laches.\n\n3.  Section 1823(e) states:\n\n          No agreement which  tends to diminish  or\n          defeat the interest of the [FDIC] in  any\n          asset  acquired by it  under this section\n          or  section 1821 of this title, either as\n          security for a loan  or by purchase or as\n          receiver   of   any  insured   depository\n          institution, shall be  valid against  the\n          Corporation unless such agreement--\n\n          1) is in writing,\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ncourt  held  that section  1823(e) barred  the Commissioner's\n\nreliance    upon  either  the  Fiduciary  Assignment  or  the\n\nRequisition (also referred to hereinafter as \"the  assignment\n\ndocuments\").    In  essence,  the  court  reasoned  that  the\n\nassignment documents constituted an \"agreement which tends to\n\ndiminish or defeat the interest of\" the  FDIC in an asset for\n\npurposes of section 1823(e).   The district court went  on to\n\nreason that, because the  assignment documents failed to meet\n\nthe requirements  set out in section 1823(e), e.g., they were\n\napproved by neither  the bank's  board of  directors nor  its\n\nloan committee, the Commissioner was barred from relying upon\n\nthem.  Therefore, the district court ordered summary judgment\n\nin favor of the FDIC.4\n\n                    \n\n          2)  was    executed    by  the depository\n          institution  and  any person  claiming an\n          adverse  interest  thereunder,  including\n          the  obligor, contemporaneously  with the\n          acquisition   of   the   asset   by   the\n          depository institution,\n\n          3) was approved by the board of directors\n          of the depository institution or its loan\n          committee, which approval shall be\n          reflected in the minutes of said board or\n          committee, and\n\n          4) has been, continuously, from the time\n          of its execution, an official record of\n          the depository institution.\n\n4.  The  district  court also  summarily  concluded  that the\nassignment  of the  certificate of  deposit \"was  not validly\nconsented to by  [Girod],   represented by Mr.  Perez.\"   The\nproceedings below  reflect only that  Girod may  have had  an\ninternal   procedure  which   required  that   two  qualified\nemployees,  rather than  a single  employee, sign  agreements\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          The sole issue before us is whether section 1823(e)\n\nbars   the  Commissioner   from  relying  on   the  Fiduciary\n\nAssignment and  the Requisition  in making his  claim against\n\nthe FDIC.  We hold that the Commissioner is not so barred.\n\nA.  Standard of Review\n                      \n\n          Where, as here, the essential  facts are undisputed\n\nand the sole issue on appeal involves a pure question of law,\n\nour  review is de novo.  See,  e.g., FDIC v. Keating, 12 F.3d\n                                                    \n\n314, 316 (lst Cir. 1993).\n\nB.  Bank Assets and Bank Liabilities\n                                    \n\n          We  begin with  crucial,  if  rudimentary,  banking\n\nterminology.  As  one commentator recently noted,  \"It may be\n\nhelpful  to recall  that  banks and  thrifts have  a somewhat\n\ncounterintuitive perspective on  the accounting of  deposits,\n\nwhich  appear   on  their  balance   sheets  as  liabilities.\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\nwhich bound Girod.   We agree with the Commissioner  that the\nbank's   own   internal   procedures   are   not  necessarily\ndispositive on the  issue of  whether the bank  was bound  by\nPerez's signature.  See, e.g., 10 Am. Jur. 2d Banks 99 (1963)\n                                                   \n(\"[W]hen  a bank opens its doors for business with the public\nand  places officers in charge,  persons dealing with them in\ngood  faith and without any  notice of any  want of authority\nwill be protected where  an act is performed in  the apparent\nscope  of the  officer's  authority, whether  the officer  is\nactually clothed with such authority or not.\").  The FDIC has\noffered no argumentation or authority to the contrary, either\nbelow or on appeal.   Thus, we conclude that the record  does\nnot  support a  conclusion  as  a  matter  of  law  that  the\nassignment was invalid.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nMeanwhile, loans from banks appear on their balance sheets as\n\nassets.\"   David G. Oedell, Private  Interbank Discipline, 16\n                                                         \n\nHarv.  J.L. &amp;  Pub.  Pol'y 327,  384  n.206 (1993)  (emphasis\n\nadded). In other words, bank deposits, including certificates\n\nof  deposit such as  the one at  issue here, see  12 U.S.C.  \n                                                \n\n1811(1)  (defining  a deposit  as,  inter  alia, \"the  unpaid\n                                               \n\nbalance of money or its equivalent received or held by a bank\n\n. . .  which is  evidenced by its  certificate of  deposit\"),\n\nrepresent obligations on the part of a bank to repay funds to\n\ndepositors.  As such, they are reflected on a bank's books as\n\nliabilities.   Loans  made to  bank  customers, on  the other\n\nhand, represent obligations on the part of borrowers to repay\n\nsums certain  to the  bank, and  as such are  reflected on  a\n\nbank's books as assets.\n\n          Obviously, the books  of failed banks contain  both\n\nassets and  liabilities.  The FDIC  fulfills vastly different\n\nfunctions  as  to the  two sides  of  a failed  bank's ledger\n\nsheet.\n\nC.  The Role of the FDIC in Bank Failures and the Purpose of\n                                                            \nD'Oench and Section 1823(e)\n                           \n\n          The  role  of the  FDIC  in bank  failures  is well\n\nestablished.    Its  \"basic  mission is  to  protect  insured\n\ndepositors,\" FDIC  v. La Rambla Shopping Ctr., Inc., 791 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n215,  218 (lst Cir. 1986),  which it does  by \"undertaking an\n\nobligation  to pay  depositors when  an insured  bank fails.\"\n\nFDIC v. Nichols, 885 F.2d 633, 636 (9th Cir. 1989).  In other\n               \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nwords, satisfying a failed bank's liabilities, especially its\n\ndeposits, is a primary goal of the FDIC.\n\n          A  failed bank's  assets,  on the  other hand,  are\n\neither liquidated or  transferred to a  solvent bank.5   See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., FDIC v. P.L.M. Int'l, Inc., 834 F.2d 248, 254 (lst Cir.\n                                \n\n1987).   Needless to say,  not all borrowers  (i.e., obligors\n\nwith  regard  to  the   bank's  assets)  happily  meet  their\n                                      \n\nobligations toward a failed bank, and many  attempt to assert\n\nclaims and defenses against the FDIC aimed at relieving those\n\nobligations.   The doctrines  enunciated in D'Oench,  Duhme &amp;\n                                                             \n\nCo.   v.  FDIC,  315  U.S.  447  (1942),  and  its  statutory\n              \n\ncounterpart, 12 U.S.C.   1823(e),  greatly limit the types of\n\nclaims  and defenses  that borrowers  may assert  against the\n\nFDIC.   In essence, such  claims and defenses  are limited to\n\nthose that  are based on  documentation in the  failed bank's\n\nrecords.  Moreover, these  doctrines governing the claims and\n\ndefenses of borrowers are designed to enable the FDIC to meet\n                     \n\nmore  effectively its  obligations to  pay depositors.

Admittedly,  the FDIC  often, as  it did  here, transfers\nobligations on both sides of a failed bank's ledger sheets to\n                   \na  solvent bank.   In   such   situations,  the solvent  bank\n\"purchases\"  certain  of  the  failed  bank's    assets,  and\nsimultaneously \"assumes\"  that bank's liabilities,  i.e., its\ndeposits.    Such  a  transaction  is  known  commonly  as  a\n\"purchase and assumption\" transaction.  See, e.g., Timberland\n                                                             \nDesign Inc. v.

The significance\n\nof  this distinction is made  clearer if we  examine, step by\n\nstep, the banking transactions at issue.\n\n                    \n\n6.  As to the existence  of an insured deposit in  this case,\nwe cannot say, given  the state of the record  below, whether\nor to what  extent we would be  willing to follow  the Eighth\nCircuit's  holding in In re Collins Sec. Corp., 998 F.2d 551,\n                                              \n554-55 (8th Cir. 1993) (holding that the  FDIC  is not liable\nin its corporate  capacity because no account  existed at the\ntime  of   the  bank's   failure  due  to   a  non-fraudulent\npre-failure  bank error).  We merely point out to the parties\nthat similar  issues may arise on remand, along with possible\njurisdictional  issues. See  La  Rambla, 791  F.2d at  220-21\n                                       \n(finding  no   jurisdictional   basis  under   12  U.S.C.    \n1819(b)(2)(D)  or (E)  for counterclaim  against FDIC  in its\ncapacity as receiver).\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          It   is  undisputed  that  Guaranty  purchased  and\n\nassigned  the  certificate  of  deposit  on  July  20,  1983.\n\nSuppose that Girod had failed  the following day, i.e., after\n\nthe purchase  and assignment  of the certificate  of deposit,\n\nbut before Guaranty  borrowed any  funds from Girod.   If  at\n\nthat point the Commissioner sought  payment from the FDIC, we\n\nthink  it  indisputable  that  neither  D'Oench  nor  section\n                                               \n\n1823(e) would be implicated at all.\n\n          Section 1823(e)  would be inapplicable  because, by\n\nits  terms, that  section  applies only  to agreements  which\n\n\"tend to diminish  or defeat the interest of the  FDIC in any\n\nasset acquired by  it.\"   Prior to Guaranty's  taking of  its\n                               \n\n$600,000 loan,  Guaranty's certificate of deposit  was merely\n\nan insured deposit, unrelated  to any particular Girod asset.\n\nGiven that  the Commissioner's claim would  diminish no Girod\n\nasset,  and  would merely  amount to  a  claim on  an insured\n\ndeposit, section 1823(e) would have no application.\n\n          Nor would  the D'Oench doctrine, in  the absence of\n                                \n\nsection 1823(e), apply in such a situation.  At its broadest,\n\nthe D'Oench  doctrine disallows claims and  defenses based on\n           \n\nschemes or arrangements \"whereby banking authorities would be\n\nmisled.\"   FDIC v. Caporale, 931  F.2d 1, 2 (lst  Cir. 1991).\n                           \n\nPrior  to  the  $600,000  loan to  Guaranty,  the  assignment\n\npresented no  such threat.   Bank examiners  would have  been\n\nfully aware  of the  bank's liability  on the certificate  of\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\ndeposit, and the Commissioner's claim merely would present an\n\nissue as  to who was entitled to payment.  Moreover, the FDIC\n\ndoes not argue  that the loan to Guaranty, in  and of itself,\n\naltered the validity of the assignment.\n\n          In  sum,  prior  to  the bank's  crediting  of  the\n                         \n\nproceeds  of the  certificate  of  deposit toward  Guaranty's\n\noutstanding indebtedness, this case  involved an insured bank\n\ndeposit,   rather  than  a   bank  asset.     It  is  equally\n\nindisputable  that  prior   to  that  crediting  transaction,\n\nneither section 1823(e) nor D'Oench would have applied to bar\n                                   \n\nthe  Commissioner's reliance upon the Fiduciary Assignment or\n\nthe Requisition in establishing his  right to the proceeds of\n\nthe certificate of  deposit.   Rather, the FDIC,  as it  does\n\nwith other  deposits, would have  paid the proceeds  from the\n\ncertificate  of  deposit   to  the  Commissioner7  upon   his\n\nestablishing  his right to those proceeds.  Cf. In re Collins\n                                                             \n\nSec. Corp., 998 F.2d  551, 553 (8th Cir. 1993)  (stating that\n          \n\nFSLIC, as  receiver for failed bank,  allowed unsecured claim\n\nby assignee of certificate of deposit  which had been wrongly\n\npaid out to assignor).\n\n                    \n\n7.  Absent the crediting of the certificate of deposit toward\nGuaranty's indebtedness,  the  Commissioner would  have  been\nentitled to its proceeds either in his capacity as  assignee,\nor in his capacity as Guaranty's receiver.  The FDIC does not\nobject to the  capacity in which the  Commissioner now brings\nthis appeal,  and we  therefore assume, without  prejudice to\nthe district court's ability to determine otherwise, that the\nCommissioner seeks recovery in his proper capacity.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nE.  Reverse  Alchemy:   Do Girod's  Pre-failure Actions  Turn\n                                                             \n\nGold\n    \ninto Lead\n         \n\n          With  breathtaking  legerdemain,  the FDIC  assumes\n\nthat,  upon   Girod's  crediting  of  the   proceeds  of  the\n\ncertificate  of deposit toward  Guaranty's $600,000 debt, the\n\nFiduciary Assignment  and  the Requisition  were  transformed\n\ninto agreements which  tend to diminish the  interests of the\n\nFDIC in an asset for purposes of section 1823(e).  We decline\n                \n\nto adopt such a rule for three related reasons.\n\n          First, assuming that  the Commissioner's version of\n\nfacts is correct,   Girod's crediting  of the certificate  of\n\ndeposit toward  Guaranty's  $600,000 loan  and the  resulting\n\n\"relationship\"  between the  certificate  of deposit  and the\n\nloan,  cannot  be   characterized  as  anything   other  than\n\nineffective.     At  the  time  that   Girod  \"credited\"  the\n\ncertificate   of   deposit   toward  Guaranty's   outstanding\n\nindebtedness,  the certificate  of deposit  had already  been\n\nvalidly assigned  to the Commissioner.  Moreover,  as   noted\n\nabove,  Puerto   Rico  law  specifically  prohibits creditors\n\nof  insurance  companies  from  levying  upon  the  statutory\n\ndeposit  at  issue here.   In  other  words, given  the valid\n\nassignment,   as    well   as   the    additional   statutory\n\nprotection it  is afforded, the certificate  of deposit could\n\nnever  rightfully   become  security  for  Girod's   loan  to\n\nGuaranty. If the  certificate could  never rightfully  secure\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nGuaranty's loan in the  first instance, we see  no principled\n\nway  of  now  holding  that it  is  nonetheless  sufficiently\n\nrelated  to that loan so as to \"diminish\" the FDIC's interest\n\nin the loan for purposes of section 1823(e).\n\n          Second, if the bank's  actions in this case somehow\n\n\"magically\"  transformed  agreements  about  a  deposit  into\n\nagreements  which  diminish the  FDIC's  interest  in a  bank\n\nasset, then all agreements about deposits, even those whereby\n\na deposit is created, could potentially be subject to section\n\n1823(e).   In other  words, any  time  a bank,  prior to  its\n\nfailure, improperly  closed a  passbook  savings account  and\n\ncredited the proceeds therein toward outstanding indebtedness\n\nfrom an  entirely unrelated  account, the depositor  would be\n\nwithout  remedy, inasmuch  as passbook  savings accounts  are\n\nrarely,  if ever, created with the approval of bank boards of\n\ndirectors  or  bank   loan  committees.    See  12  U.S.C.   \n                                              \n\n1823(e)(3).   We have no  doubt that Congress  could not have\n\nintended such a result.\n\n          Third,  neither  the Fiduciary  Assignment  nor the\n\nRequisition  constitutes  an  \"agreement\"  for   purposes  of\n\nsection 1823(e).  Cf.  Bateman v. FDIC, 970 F.2d  924, 927-29\n                                      \n\n(lst Cir.  1992) (holding  that bank's consent  to mechanics'\n\nlien was not an \"agreement\" for purposes of section 1823(e)).\n\nThe  bank's  \"acceptance\"  of  the assignment  here  did  not\n\ninvolve bargaining, consideration,  an exchange of  promises,\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nor  many  other   ordinary  accoutrements   of  a   classical\n\ncontractual \"agreement.\"   See Langley v. FDIC, 484  U.S. 86,\n                                              \n\n91 (1987) (defining \"agreement\" as used in section 1823(e) in\n\nterms of  traditional  contract  principles).    Rather,  the\n\nbank's \"acceptance\"  of the  assignment in this  case appears\n\nvery similar  to the mortgagee's \"consent\"  to the imposition\n\nof  a mechanic's lien in  Bateman.  \"Consent\"  in Bateman was\n                                                         \n\nrequired  by state law  to give the  mechanic's lien priority\n\nover the mortgagee's lien.  Bateman, 970 F.2d  at 927-29.  We\n                                   \n\nheld there that the  mortgagee's \"consent\" did not  amount to\n\nan \"agreement\" for purposes  of section 1823(e).  Id.   Here,\n                                                     \n\nthe state  law mechanism  whereby the certificate  of deposit\n\nwas  created,  assigned  to  the  Commissioner,  and  further\n\nprotected from levying  by creditors is similar  to the state\n\nmechanic's  lien system in Bateman.   Thus, for quite similar\n                                  \n\npractical and conceptual reasons, we reach a similar result.\n\n          As a  final argument urging a  contrary result, the\n\nFDIC  relies heavily on language  on the reverse  side of the\n\ncertificate of deposit itself, which states that the proceeds\n\nof the certificate may be applied against the named obligee's\n\noutstanding indebtedness.  The rationale behind this argument\n\nappears to be that this language warned the Commissioner that\n\nGirod  had a  right,  upon maturity  of  the certificate,  to\n\ncredit  the   certificate  of  deposit   against  outstanding\n\nindebtedness  on  a  bank   asset,  and  that  therefore  the\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nCommissioner, though still  an obligee of  the bank,   should\n                                      \n\nhave sought written board approval of the assignment, much as\n\na D'Oench-wary obligor would.  Again, we disagree.\n         \n\n          First, the  certificate  of  deposit  was,  by  its\n\nterms,  assignable.8   Second,  the  FDIC's  argument  places\n\ndepositors  and  their  assignees  essentially  in  the  same\n\nposition  as borrowers,  requiring  that  they guard  against\n\npurely  contingent  (and  in  this  case,  contractually  and\n\nstatutorily  forbidden) bookkeeping maneuvers  on the part of\n\nthe failed bank.   Moreover, in this case, such  an expansive\n\nreading of  the dual  doctrines would penalize   rather  than\n\nreward, a  depositor who, unlike most  other depositors, took\n\nsteps  to preserve and memorialize his rights.  We decline to\n\nadopt such a novel and onerous reading of the relevant law.\n\n          We reemphasize  that this case does  not involve an\n\neffort  by a borrower who,  having promised his bank deposits\n\nas  security  for  a  loan, later  attempts  to  destroy that\n\nsecurity  by asserting an oral promise by the bank to release\n\nthat security notwithstanding  the prior written  commitment.\n\nHere, the borrower did not promise the certificate of deposit\n\nas  security for its loan  and, indeed, did  not even own the\n\n                    \n\n8.  Language  on  the  reverse  side of  the  certificate  of\ndeposit stated:\n          The  assignment of this  Certificate to a\n          third  party will not be considered valid\n          until said transaction has  been notified\n          to, and accepted by the bank.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\ncertificate of deposit at the time it borrowed the money from\n\nthe bank, for  it had previously assigned the  certificate of\n\ndeposit to the Commissioner.   Moreover, the borrower in this\n\ncase, namely Guaranty, is  not claiming any rights at  all to\n\nthe  funds at  issue.   Rather, the  sole issue before  us is\n\nwhether section  1823(e)   applies to bar  the Commissioner's\n\nclaims,  and we conclude that it does not.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  order  of   the\n\ndistrict court entering summary judgment in favor of the FDIC\n\nbased upon the application of 12 U.S.C.   1823(e) is\n\n          Reversed  and  remanded  for   further  proceedings\n                                                             \n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                             \n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n",

Simultaneously with its purchase, the certificate was assigned to a third party, the Insurance Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"the Commissioner\").  The Commissioner brought suit against the FDIC seeking to establish his right to the proceeds of the certificate, and attempted to introduce documents evidencing both the assignment and the bank's acknowledgment thereof.  The district court applied 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e) to bar the assignee's use of the assignment documents.  Finding both section 1823(e) and the D'Oench<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> doctrine inapplicable, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are essentially undisputed.  In order to do business in the commonwealth, Puerto Rico insurance companies are first required by law to deposit funds with the Commissioner.  See 26 L.P.R.A. Secs. 801-809.  Moreover, once these funds are deposited, Puerto Rico law provides that they may not be levied upon by creditors or claimants of the insurance company.  Id. Sec. 809 (\"No judgment creditor or other claimant of an insurer shall levy upon any deposit held pursuant to this chapter, or upon any part thereof.\").  On July 20, 1983, in order to satisfy the statutory deposit requirement, Guaranty Insurance Co.  (\"Guaranty\") purchased a six-month certificate of deposit from the Girod Trust Company (\"Girod\" or \"the bank\") in the principal amount of $50,000.  The certificate of deposit had a maturity date of January 17, 1984.  On the same day that it purchased the certificate, Guaranty, through one of its officers, executed a separate document entitled a \"Fiduciary Assignment\" in which it irrevocably assigned and conveyed its interest in the certificate of deposit to the Commissioner.  Girod was not a party to the Fiduciary Assignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accompanying both the certificate of deposit and the Fiduciary Assignment was yet another document executed on the same date, July 20, 1983, entitled \"Requisition to the Bank.\"   This Requisition stated, inter alia, that Girod would not release the funds represented by the certificate of deposit, \"whether the principal value or income thereof,\" without the authorization of the Commissioner.  More specifically, the Requisition stated, \"[W]e [Girod] agree and promise to dispose of the certificate of deposit ... only with prior authorization from the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico.\"   The Requisition was signed by Allwin Perez \"in his capacity as manager of the San Juan branch of Girod Trust Company.\"   His signature was notarized.  Like the Fiduciary Assignment, the Requisition stated, \"This requisition will be irrevocable.\"   The certificate of deposit itself was given to, and remains with, the Commissioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than three months after purchasing the certificate of deposit from Girod, Guaranty executed a loan agreement, unrelated to the certificate of deposit, pursuant to which it borrowed $600,000 from Girod.  The loan was evidenced by a promissory note for that amount, payable to Girod.  The note was due on April 26, 1984, and Guaranty began making payments according to the loan agreement's schedule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 1984, the certificate of deposit came due.  At the request of Guaranty, it was \"rolled over,\" i.e., extended for a term of six additional months.  In the meantime, Guaranty had fallen behind on payments due to Girod under the $600,000 loan agreement.  On July 16, 1984, the certificate of deposit came due again.  This time, however, the certificate was not \"rolled over.\"   Rather, on July 18, 1984, two days after the certificate had matured, the proceeds were credited to Guaranty's account.  Specifically, $50,000 from the certificate of deposit was credited toward Guaranty's outstanding indebtedness under the $600,000 loan agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 1984, Girod was declared insolvent and the FDIC was appointed receiver.  On December 19, 1984, Guaranty also became insolvent.  The Commissioner was appointed Guaranty's receiver.  On August 25, 1986, the Commissioner filed a proof of claim with the FDIC, seeking payment on the certificate of deposit.  On May 22, 1991, having received no payment on the claim, the Commissioner filed a complaint against the FDIC in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico seeking to recover the proceeds of the certificate of deposit.  The FDIC removed the action to federal court pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1819(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Without ruling on the motions, the district court asked the parties to submit briefs on the application of 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Upon submission of the briefs, the district court held that section 1823(e) barred the Commissioner's reliance upon either the Fiduciary Assignment or the Requisition (also referred to hereinafter as \"the assignment documents\").  In essence, the court reasoned that the assignment documents constituted an \"agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of\" the FDIC in an asset for purposes of section 1823(e).  The district court went on to reason that, because the assignment documents failed to meet the requirements set out in section 1823(e), e.g., they were approved by neither the bank's board of directors nor its loan committee, the Commissioner was barred from relying upon them.  Therefore, the district court ordered summary judgment in favor of the FDIC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole issue before us is whether section 1823(e) bars the Commissioner from relying on the Fiduciary Assignment and the Requisition in making his claim against the FDIC.  We hold that the Commissioner is not so barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the essential facts are undisputed and the sole issue on appeal involves a pure question of law, our review is de novo.  See, e.g., FDIC v. Keating, 12 F.3d 314, 316 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Bank Assets and Bank Liabilities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with crucial, if rudimentary, banking terminology.  As one commentator recently noted, \"It may be helpful to recall that banks and thrifts have a somewhat counterintuitive perspective on the accounting of deposits, which appear on their balance sheets as liabilities.   Meanwhile, loans from banks appear on their balance sheets as assets.\"   David G. Oedell, Private Interbank Discipline, 16 Harv.J.L. &amp; Pub.Pol'y 327, 384 n. 206 (1993) (emphasis added).  In other words, bank deposits, including certificates of deposit such as the one at issue here, see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 183(l ) (defining a deposit as, inter alia, \"the unpaid balance of money or its equivalent received or held by a bank ... which is evidenced by its certificate of deposit\"), represent obligations on the part of a bank to repay funds to depositors.  As such, they are reflected on a bank's books as liabilities.  Loans made to bank customers, on the other hand, represent obligations on the part of borrowers to repay sums certain to the bank, and as such are reflected on a bank's books as assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, the books of failed banks contain both assets and liabilities.  The FDIC fulfills vastly different functions as to the two sides of a failed bank's ledger sheet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>C. The Role of the FDIC in Bank Failures and the Purpose of D'Oench and Section 1823(e)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The role of the FDIC in bank failures is well established.  Its \"basic mission is to protect insured depositors,\" FDIC v. La Rambla Shopping Ctr., Inc., 791 F.2d 215, 218 (1st Cir.1986), which it does by \"undertaking an obligation to pay depositors when an insured bank fails.\"  FDIC v. Nichols, 885 F.2d 633, 636 (9th Cir.1989).  In other words, satisfying a failed bank's liabilities, especially its deposits, is a primary goal of the FDIC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A failed bank's assets, on the other hand, are either liquidated or transferred to a solvent bank.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., FDIC v. P.L.M. Int'l, Inc., 834 F.2d 248, 254 (1st Cir.1987).  Needless to say, not all borrowers (i.e., obligors with regard to the bank's assets ) happily meet their obligations toward a failed bank, and many attempt to assert claims and defenses against the FDIC aimed at relieving those obligations.  The doctrines enunciated in D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447, 62 S.Ct. 676, 86 L.Ed. 956 (1942), and its statutory counterpart, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e), greatly limit the types of claims and defenses that borrowers may assert against the FDIC.  In essence, such claims and defenses are limited to those that are based on documentation in the failed bank's records.  Moreover, these doctrines governing the claims and defenses of borrowers are designed to enable the FDIC to meet more effectively its obligations to pay depositors.  See, e.g., Timberland Design Inc. v. First Serv.  Bank for Savs., 932 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1991) (\" '[T]he D'Oench Duhme doctrine ... favors the interests of depositors and creditors of a failed bank, who cannot protect themselves from secret agreements, over the interests of borrowers, who can.' \")  (emphasis supplied) (quoting Bell &amp; Murphy &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Interfirst Bank Gateway, N.A., 894 F.2d 750, 754 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 895, 111 S.Ct. 244, 112 L.Ed.2d 203 (1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>D. The Assignment Documents:  Agreements Affecting a Bank Deposit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the transaction here, it is evident that at the time the certificate of deposit was purchased and the Fiduciary Assignment and the Requisition were executed, they were agreements having an effect on one of Girod's insured deposits,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> rather than one of its assets.  The significance of this distinction is made clearer if we examine, step by step, the banking transactions at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Guaranty purchased and assigned the certificate of deposit on July 20, 1983.  Suppose that Girod had failed the following day, i.e., after the purchase and assignment of the certificate of deposit, but before Guaranty borrowed any funds from Girod.  If at that point the Commissioner sought payment from the FDIC, we think it indisputable that neither D'Oench nor section 1823(e) would be implicated at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1823(e) would be inapplicable because, by its terms, that section applies only to agreements which \"tend to diminish or defeat the interest of the FDIC in any asset acquired by it.\"   Prior to Guaranty's taking of its $600,000 loan, Guaranty's certificate of deposit was merely an insured deposit, unrelated to any particular Girod asset.  Given that the Commissioner's claim would diminish no Girod asset, and would merely amount to a claim on an insured deposit, section 1823(e) would have no application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor would the D'Oench doctrine, in the absence of section 1823(e), apply in such a situation.  At its broadest, the D'Oench doctrine disallows claims and defenses based on schemes or arrangements \"whereby banking authorities would be misled.\"  FDIC v. Caporale, 931 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1991).  Prior to the $600,000 loan to Guaranty, the assignment presented no such threat.  Bank examiners would have been fully aware of the bank's liability on the certificate of deposit, and the Commissioner's claim merely would present an issue as to who was entitled to payment.  Moreover, the FDIC does not argue that the loan to Guaranty, in and of itself, altered the validity of the assignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, prior to the bank's crediting of the proceeds of the certificate of deposit toward Guaranty's outstanding indebtedness, this case involved an insured bank deposit, rather than a bank asset.  It is equally indisputable that prior to that crediting transaction, neither section 1823(e) nor D'Oench would have applied to bar the Commissioner's reliance upon the Fiduciary Assignment or the Requisition in establishing his right to the proceeds of the certificate of deposit.  Rather, the FDIC, as it does with other deposits, would have paid the proceeds from the certificate of deposit to the Commissioner<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> upon his establishing his right to those proceeds.  Cf. In re Collins Sec. Corp., 998 F.2d 551, 553 (8th Cir.1993) (stating that FSLIC, as receiver for failed bank, allowed unsecured claim by assignee of certificate of deposit which had been wrongly paid out to assignor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>E. Reverse Alchemy:  Do Girod's Pre-failure Actions Turn Gold into Lead</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With breathtaking legerdemain, the FDIC assumes that, upon Girod's crediting of the proceeds of the certificate of deposit toward Guaranty's $600,000 debt, the Fiduciary Assignment and the Requisition were transformed into agreements which tend to diminish the interests of the FDIC in an asset for purposes of section 1823(e).  We decline to adopt such a rule for three related reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, assuming that the Commissioner's version of facts is correct, Girod's crediting of the certificate of deposit toward Guaranty's $600,000 loan and the resulting \"relationship\" between the certificate of deposit and the loan, cannot be characterized as anything other than ineffective.  At the time that Girod \"credited\" the certificate of deposit toward Guaranty's outstanding indebtedness, the certificate of deposit had already been validly assigned to the Commissioner.  Moreover, as noted above, Puerto Rico law specifically prohibits creditors of insurance companies from levying upon the statutory deposit at issue here.  In other words, given the valid assignment, as well as the additional statutory protection it is afforded, the certificate of deposit could never rightfully become security for Girod's loan to Guaranty.  If the certificate could never rightfully secure Guaranty's loan in the first instance, we see no principled way of now holding that it is nonetheless sufficiently related to that loan so as to \"diminish\" the FDIC's interest in the loan for purposes of section 1823(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if the bank's actions in this case somehow \"magically\" transformed agreements about a deposit into agreements which diminish the FDIC's interest in a bank asset, then all agreements about deposits, even those whereby a deposit is created, could potentially be subject to section 1823(e).  In other words, any time a bank, prior to its failure, improperly closed a passbook savings account and credited the proceeds therein toward outstanding indebtedness from an entirely unrelated account, the depositor would be without remedy, inasmuch as passbook savings accounts are rarely, if ever, created with the approval of bank boards of directors or bank loan committees.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e)(3).  We have no doubt that Congress could not have intended such a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, neither the Fiduciary Assignment nor the Requisition constitutes an \"agreement\" for purposes of section 1823(e).  Cf. Bateman v. FDIC, 970 F.2d 924, 927-29 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that bank's consent to mechanics' lien was not an \"agreement\" for purposes of section 1823(e)).  The bank's \"acceptance\" of the assignment here did not involve bargaining, consideration, an exchange of promises, or many other ordinary accoutrements of a classical contractual \"agreement.\"   See Langley v. FDIC, 484 U.S. 86, 91, 108 S.Ct. 396, 401, 98 L.Ed.2d 340 (1987) (defining \"agreement\" as used in section 1823(e) in terms of traditional contract principles).  Rather, the bank's \"acceptance\" of the assignment in this case appears very similar to the mortgagee's \"consent\" to the imposition of a mechanic's lien in Bateman. \"Consent\" in Bateman was required by state law to give the mechanic's lien priority over the mortgagee's lien.  Bateman, 970 F.2d at 927-29.   We held there that the mortgagee's \"consent\" did not amount to an \"agreement\" for purposes of section 1823(e).  Id.  Here, the state law mechanism whereby the certificate of deposit was created, assigned to the Commissioner, and further protected from levying by creditors is similar to the state mechanic's lien system in Bateman.   Thus, for quite similar practical and conceptual reasons, we reach a similar result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a final argument urging a contrary result, the FDIC relies heavily on language on the reverse side of the certificate of deposit itself, which states that the proceeds of the certificate may be applied against the named obligee's outstanding indebtedness.  The rationale behind this argument appears to be that this language warned the Commissioner that Girod had a right, upon maturity of the certificate, to credit the certificate of deposit against outstanding indebtedness on a bank asset, and that therefore the Commissioner, though still an obligee of the bank, should have sought written board approval of the assignment, much as a D'Oench-wary obligor would.  Again, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the certificate of deposit was, by its terms, assignable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Second, the FDIC's argument places depositors and their assignees essentially in the same position as borrowers, requiring that they guard against purely contingent (and in this case, contractually and statutorily forbidden) bookkeeping maneuvers on the part of the failed bank.  Moreover, in this case, such an expansive reading of the dual doctrines would penalize rather than reward, a depositor who, unlike most other depositors, took steps to preserve and memorialize his rights.  We decline to adopt such a novel and onerous reading of the relevant law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reemphasize that this case does not involve an effort by a borrower who, having promised his bank deposits as security for a loan, later attempts to destroy that security by asserting an oral promise by the bank to release that security notwithstanding the prior written commitment.  Here, the borrower did not promise the certificate of deposit as security for its loan and, indeed, did not even own the certificate of deposit at the time it borrowed the money from the bank, for it had previously assigned the certificate of deposit to the Commissioner.  Moreover, the borrower in this case, namely Guaranty, is not claiming any rights at all to the funds at issue.  Rather, the sole issue before us is whether section 1823(e) applies to bar the Commissioner's claims, and we conclude that it does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court entering summary judgment in favor of the FDIC based upon the application of 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e) is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As we pointed out in McCullough v. FDIC, 987 F.2d 870, 874 (1st Cir.1993), section 1823(e) is \"somewhat loosely described as the codification\" of the D'Oench doctrine, and the parties' briefs in this case address both D'Oench and its \"statutory partner,\" id. at 874 n. 6.   Seeing no reason to except D'Oench from our discussion, we address the application of both doctrines</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Commissioner argued, in essence, that the offset was improper and that he was entitled to the proceeds of the certificate of deposit.  The FDIC argued, inter alia, that the Commissioner's claim was barred by laches</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Section 1823(e) states:</p>\n        <p>No agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of the [FDIC] in any asset acquired by it under this section or section 1821 of this title, either as security for a loan or by purchase or as receiver of any insured depository institution, shall be valid against the Corporation unless such agreement--</p>\n        <p>1) is in writing,</p>\n        <p>2) was executed by the depository institution and any person claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the depository institution,</p>\n        <p>3) was approved by the board of directors of the depository institution or its loan committee, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said board or committee, and</p>\n        <p>4) has been, continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the depository institution.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court also summarily concluded that the assignment of the certificate of deposit \"was not validly consented to by [Girod], represented by Mr. Perez.\"   The proceedings below reflect only that Girod may have had an internal procedure which required that two qualified employees, rather than a single employee, sign agreements which bound Girod.  We agree with the Commissioner that the bank's own internal procedures are not necessarily dispositive on the issue of whether the bank was bound by Perez's signature.  See, e.g., 10 Am.Jur.2d Banks 99 (1963) (\"[W]hen a bank opens its doors for business with the public and places officers in charge, persons dealing with them in good faith and without any notice of any want of authority will be protected where an act is performed in the apparent scope of the officer's authority, whether the officer is actually clothed with such authority or not.\").  The FDIC has offered no argumentation or authority to the contrary, either below or on appeal.  Thus, we conclude that the record does not support a conclusion as a matter of law that the assignment was invalid</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Admittedly, the FDIC often, as it did here, transfers obligations on both sides of a failed bank's ledger sheets to a solvent bank.  In such situations, the solvent bank \"purchases\" certain of the failed bank's assets, and simultaneously \"assumes\" that bank's liabilities, i.e., its deposits.  Such a transaction is known commonly as a \"purchase and assumption\" transaction.  See, e.g., Timberland Design Inc. v. First Serv.  Bank for Savs., 932 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1991);  La Rambla, 791 F.2d at 218.   Depositors then maintain their insured deposits, while borrowers continue to meet their obligations, allowing banking business to continue with some regularity</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> As to the existence of an insured deposit in this case, we cannot say, given the state of the record below, whether or to what extent we would be willing to follow the Eighth Circuit's holding in In re Collins Sec. Corp., 998 F.2d 551, 554-55 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that the FDIC is not liable in its corporate capacity because no account existed at the time of the bank's failure due to a non-fraudulent pre-failure bank error).  We merely point out to the parties that similar issues may arise on remand, along with possible jurisdictional issues.  See La Rambla, 791 F.2d at 220-21 (finding no jurisdictional basis under 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D) or (E) for counterclaim against FDIC in its capacity as receiver)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Absent the crediting of the certificate of deposit toward Guaranty's indebtedness, the Commissioner would have been entitled to its proceeds either in his capacity as assignee, or in his capacity as Guaranty's receiver.

Simultaneously with its purchase, the certificate was assigned to a third party, the Insurance Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"the Commissioner\").  The Commissioner brought suit against the FDIC seeking to establish his right to the proceeds of the certificate, and attempted to introduce documents evidencing both the assignment and the bank's acknowledgment thereof.  The district court applied 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e) to bar the assignee's use of the assignment documents.  Finding both section 1823(e) and the D'Oench<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> doctrine inapplicable, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are essentially undisputed.  In order to do business in the commonwealth, Puerto Rico insurance companies are first required by law to deposit funds with the Commissioner.  See 26 L.P.R.A. Secs. 801-809.  Moreover, once these funds are deposited, Puerto Rico law provides that they may not be levied upon by creditors or claimants of the insurance company.  Id. Sec. 809 (\"No judgment creditor or other claimant of an insurer shall levy upon any deposit held pursuant to this chapter, or upon any part thereof.\").  On July 20, 1983, in order to satisfy the statutory deposit requirement, Guaranty Insurance Co.  (\"Guaranty\") purchased a six-month certificate of deposit from the Girod Trust Company (\"Girod\" or \"the bank\") in the principal amount of $50,000.  The certificate of deposit had a maturity date of January 17, 1984.  On the same day that it purchased the certificate, Guaranty, through one of its officers, executed a separate document entitled a \"Fiduciary Assignment\" in which it irrevocably assigned and conveyed its interest in the certificate of deposit to the Commissioner.  Girod was not a party to the Fiduciary Assignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accompanying both the certificate of deposit and the Fiduciary Assignment was yet another document executed on the same date, July 20, 1983, entitled \"Requisition to the Bank.\"   This Requisition stated, inter alia, that Girod would not release the funds represented by the certificate of deposit, \"whether the principal value or income thereof,\" without the authorization of the Commissioner.  More specifically, the Requisition stated, \"[W]e [Girod] agree and promise to dispose of the certificate of deposit ... only with prior authorization from the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico.\"   The Requisition was signed by Allwin Perez \"in his capacity as manager of the San Juan branch of Girod Trust Company.\"   His signature was notarized.  Like the Fiduciary Assignment, the Requisition stated, \"This requisition will be irrevocable.\"   The certificate of deposit itself was given to, and remains with, the Commissioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than three months after purchasing the certificate of deposit from Girod, Guaranty executed a loan agreement, unrelated to the certificate of deposit, pursuant to which it borrowed $600,000 from Girod.  The loan was evidenced by a promissory note for that amount, payable to Girod.  The note was due on April 26, 1984, and Guaranty began making payments according to the loan agreement's schedule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 1984, the certificate of deposit came due.  At the request of Guaranty, it was \"rolled over,\" i.e., extended for a term of six additional months.  In the meantime, Guaranty had fallen behind on payments due to Girod under the $600,000 loan agreement.  On July 16, 1984, the certificate of deposit came due again.  This time, however, the certificate was not \"rolled over.\"   Rather, on July 18, 1984, two days after the certificate had matured, the proceeds were credited to Guaranty's account.  Specifically, $50,000 from the certificate of deposit was credited toward Guaranty's outstanding indebtedness under the $600,000 loan agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 1984, Girod was declared insolvent and the FDIC was appointed receiver.  On December 19, 1984, Guaranty also became insolvent.  The Commissioner was appointed Guaranty's receiver.  On August 25, 1986, the Commissioner filed a proof of claim with the FDIC, seeking payment on the certificate of deposit.  On May 22, 1991, having received no payment on the claim, the Commissioner filed a complaint against the FDIC in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico seeking to recover the proceeds of the certificate of deposit.  The FDIC removed the action to federal court pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1819(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Without ruling on the motions, the district court asked the parties to submit briefs on the application of 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Upon submission of the briefs, the district court held that section 1823(e) barred the Commissioner's reliance upon either the Fiduciary Assignment or the Requisition (also referred to hereinafter as \"the assignment documents\").  In essence, the court reasoned that the assignment documents constituted an \"agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of\" the FDIC in an asset for purposes of section 1823(e).  The district court went on to reason that, because the assignment documents failed to meet the requirements set out in section 1823(e), e.g., they were approved by neither the bank's board of directors nor its loan committee, the Commissioner was barred from relying upon them.  Therefore, the district court ordered summary judgment in favor of the FDIC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole issue before us is whether section 1823(e) bars the Commissioner from relying on the Fiduciary Assignment and the Requisition in making his claim against the FDIC.

Keating, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195109\"><a href=\"/opinion/195109/fdic-v-keating/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 316 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Bank Assets and Bank Liabilities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with crucial, if rudimentary, banking terminology.  As one commentator recently noted, \"It may be helpful to recall that banks and thrifts have a somewhat counterintuitive perspective on the accounting of deposits, which appear on their balance sheets as liabilities.   Meanwhile, loans from banks appear on their balance sheets as assets.\"   David G. Oedell, Private Interbank Discipline, 16 Harv.J.L. &amp; Pub.Pol'y 327, 384 n. 206 (1993) (emphasis added).  In other words, bank deposits, including certificates of deposit such as the one at issue here, see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 183(l ) (defining a deposit as, inter alia, \"the unpaid balance of money or its equivalent received or held by a bank ... which is evidenced by its certificate of deposit\"), represent obligations on the part of a bank to repay funds to depositors.  As such, they are reflected on a bank's books as liabilities.  Loans made to bank customers, on the other hand, represent obligations on the part of borrowers to repay sums certain to the bank, and as such are reflected on a bank's books as assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, the books of failed banks contain both assets and liabilities.

In other words, satisfying a failed bank's liabilities, especially its deposits, is a primary goal of the FDIC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A failed bank's assets, on the other hand, are either liquidated or transferred to a solvent bank.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., FDIC v. P.L.M.

Needless to say, not all borrowers (i.e., obligors with regard to the bank's assets ) happily meet their obligations toward a failed bank, and many attempt to assert claims and defenses against the FDIC aimed at relieving those obligations.  The doctrines enunciated in D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103624\"><a href=\"/opinion/103624/doench-duhme-co-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Sec. 1823(e), greatly limit the types of claims and defenses that borrowers may assert against the FDIC.  In essence, such claims and defenses are limited to those that are based on documentation in the failed bank's records.  Moreover, these doctrines governing the claims and defenses of borrowers are designed to enable the FDIC to meet more effectively its obligations to pay depositors.

The significance of this distinction is made clearer if we examine, step by step, the banking transactions at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Guaranty purchased and assigned the certificate of deposit on July 20, 1983.  Suppose that Girod had failed the following day, i.e., after the purchase and assignment of the certificate of deposit, but before Guaranty borrowed any funds from Girod.  If at that point the Commissioner sought payment from the FDIC, we think it indisputable that neither D'Oench nor section 1823(e) would be implicated at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1823(e) would be inapplicable because, by its terms, that section applies only to agreements which \"tend to diminish or defeat the interest of the FDIC in any asset acquired by it.\"   Prior to Guaranty's taking of its $600,000 loan, Guaranty's certificate of deposit was merely an insured deposit, unrelated to any particular Girod asset.  Given that the Commissioner's claim would diminish no Girod asset, and would merely amount to a claim on an insured deposit, section 1823(e) would have no application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor would the D'Oench doctrine, in the absence of section 1823(e), apply in such a situation.  At its broadest, the D'Oench doctrine disallows claims and defenses based on schemes or arrangements \"whereby banking authorities would be misled.\"  FDIC v. Caporale, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559591\"><a href=\"/opinion/559591/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-etc-v-leonard-caporale-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1991).  Prior to the $600,000 loan to Guaranty, the assignment presented no such threat.  Bank examiners would have been fully aware of the bank's liability on the certificate of deposit, and the Commissioner's claim merely would present an issue as to who was entitled to payment.  Moreover, the FDIC does not argue that the loan to Guaranty, in and of itself, altered the validity of the assignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, prior to the bank's crediting of the proceeds of the certificate of deposit toward Guaranty's outstanding indebtedness, this case involved an insured bank deposit, rather than a bank asset.  It is equally indisputable that prior to that crediting transaction, neither section 1823(e) nor D'Oench would have applied to bar the Commissioner's reliance upon the Fiduciary Assignment or the Requisition in establishing his right to the proceeds of the certificate of deposit.  Rather, the FDIC, as it does with other deposits, would have paid the proceeds from the certificate of deposit to the Commissioner<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> upon his establishing his right to those proceeds.  Cf. In re Collins Sec. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610983\"><a href=\"/opinion/610983/in-re-collins-securities-corporation-debtor-harvey-bell-trustee-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span>, 553 (8th Cir.1993) (stating that FSLIC, as receiver for failed bank, allowed unsecured claim by assignee of certificate of deposit which had been wrongly paid out to assignor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>E. Reverse Alchemy:  Do Girod's Pre-failure Actions Turn Gold into Lead</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With breathtaking legerdemain, the FDIC assumes that, upon Girod's crediting of the proceeds of the certificate of deposit toward Guaranty's $600,000 debt, the Fiduciary Assignment and the Requisition were transformed into agreements which tend to diminish the interests of the FDIC in an asset for purposes of section 1823(e).  We decline to adopt such a rule for three related reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, assuming that the Commissioner's version of facts is correct, Girod's crediting of the certificate of deposit toward Guaranty's $600,000 loan and the resulting \"relationship\" between the certificate of deposit and the loan, cannot be characterized as anything other than ineffective.  At the time that Girod \"credited\" the certificate of deposit toward Guaranty's outstanding indebtedness, the certificate of deposit had already been validly assigned to the Commissioner.  Moreover, as noted above, Puerto Rico law specifically prohibits creditors of insurance companies from levying upon the statutory deposit at issue here.  In other words, given the valid assignment, as well as the additional statutory protection it is afforded, the certificate of deposit could never rightfully become security for Girod's loan to Guaranty.  If the certificate could never rightfully secure Guaranty's loan in the first instance, we see no principled way of now holding that it is nonetheless sufficiently related to that loan so as to \"diminish\" the FDIC's interest in the loan for purposes of section 1823(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if the bank's actions in this case somehow \"magically\" transformed agreements about a deposit into agreements which diminish the FDIC's interest in a bank asset, then all agreements about deposits, even those whereby a deposit is created, could potentially be subject to section 1823(e).  In other words, any time a bank, prior to its failure, improperly closed a passbook savings account and credited the proceeds therein toward outstanding indebtedness from an entirely unrelated account, the depositor would be without remedy, inasmuch as passbook savings accounts are rarely, if ever, created with the approval of bank boards of directors or bank loan committees.  See 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1823(e)(3).  We have no doubt that Congress could not have intended such a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, neither the Fiduciary Assignment nor the Requisition constitutes an \"agreement\" for purposes of section 1823(e).  Cf. Bateman v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587565\"><a href=\"/opinion/587565/david-bateman-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-everett-n-dobson/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span>, 927-29 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that bank's consent to mechanics' lien was not an \"agreement\" for purposes of section 1823(e)).  The bank's \"acceptance\" of the assignment here did not involve bargaining, consideration, an exchange of promises, or many other ordinary accoutrements of a classical contractual \"agreement.\"   See Langley v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111968\"><a href=\"/opinion/111968/langley-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111968\"><a href=\"/opinion/111968/langley-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span> (1987) (defining \"agreement\" as used in section 1823(e) in terms of traditional contract principles).  Rather, the bank's \"acceptance\" of the assignment in this case appears very similar to the mortgagee's \"consent\" to the imposition of a mechanic's lien in Bateman. \"Consent\" in Bateman was required by state law to give the mechanic's lien priority over the mortgagee's lien.  Bateman, 970 F.2d at 927-29.   We held there that the mortgagee's \"consent\" did not amount to an \"agreement\" for purposes of section 1823(e).  Id.  Here, the state law mechanism whereby the certificate of deposit was created, assigned to the Commissioner, and further protected from levying by creditors is similar to the state mechanic's lien system in Bateman.   Thus, for quite similar practical and conceptual reasons, we reach a similar result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a final argument urging a contrary result, the FDIC relies heavily on language on the reverse side of the certificate of deposit itself, which states that the proceeds of the certificate may be applied against the named obligee's outstanding indebtedness.  The rationale behind this argument appears to be that this language warned the Commissioner that Girod had a right, upon maturity of the certificate, to credit the certificate of deposit against outstanding indebtedness on a bank asset, and that therefore the Commissioner, though still an obligee of the bank, should have sought written board approval of the assignment, much as a D'Oench-wary obligor would.  Again, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the certificate of deposit was, by its terms, assignable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Second, the FDIC's argument places depositors and their assignees essentially in the same position as borrowers, requiring that they guard against purely contingent (and in this case, contractually and statutorily forbidden) bookkeeping maneuvers on the part of the failed bank.  Moreover, in this case, such an expansive reading of the dual doctrines would penalize rather than reward, a depositor who, unlike most other depositors, took steps to preserve and memorialize his rights.  We decline to adopt such a novel and onerous reading of the relevant law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reemphasize that this case does not involve an effort by a borrower who, having promised his bank deposits as security for a loan, later attempts to destroy that security by asserting an oral promise by the bank to release that security notwithstanding the prior written commitment.  Here, the borrower did not promise the certificate of deposit as security for its loan and, indeed, did not even own the certificate of deposit at the time it borrowed the money from the bank, for it had previously assigned the certificate of deposit to the Commissioner.  Moreover, the borrower in this case, namely Guaranty, is not claiming any rights at all to the funds at issue.  Rather, the sole issue before us is whether section 1823(e) applies to bar the Commissioner's claims, and we conclude that it does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court entering summary judgment in favor of the FDIC based upon the application of 12 U.S.C.

The FDIC argued, inter alia, that the Commissioner's claim was barred by laches</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Section 1823(e) states:</p>\n        <p>No agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of the [FDIC] in any asset acquired by it under this section or section 1821 of this title, either as security for a loan or by purchase or as receiver of any insured depository institution, shall be valid against the Corporation unless such agreement--</p>\n        <p>1) is in writing,</p>\n        <p>2) was executed by the depository institution and any person claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the depository institution,</p>\n        <p>3) was approved by the board of directors of the depository institution or its loan committee, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said board or committee, and</p>\n        <p>4) has been, continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the depository institution.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court also summarily concluded that the assignment of the certificate of deposit \"was not validly consented to by [Girod], represented by Mr. Perez.\"   The proceedings below reflect only that Girod may have had an internal procedure which required that two qualified employees, rather than a single employee, sign agreements which bound Girod.  We agree with the Commissioner that the bank's own internal procedures are not necessarily dispositive on the issue of whether the bank was bound by Perez's signature.  See, e.g., 10 Am.Jur.2d Banks 99 (1963) (\"[W]hen a bank opens its doors for business with the public and places officers in charge, persons dealing with them in good faith and without any notice of any want of authority will be protected where an act is performed in the apparent scope of the officer's authority, whether the officer is actually clothed with such authority or not.\").  The FDIC has offered no argumentation or authority to the contrary, either below or on appeal.  Thus, we conclude that the record does not support a conclusion as a matter of law that the assignment was invalid</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Admittedly, the FDIC often, as it did here, transfers obligations on both sides of a failed bank's ledger sheets to a solvent bank.  In such situations, the solvent bank \"purchases\" certain of the failed bank's assets, and simultaneously \"assumes\" that bank's liabilities, i.e., its deposits.  Such a transaction is known commonly as a \"purchase and assumption\" transaction.  See, e.g., Timberland Design Inc. v. First Serv.  Bank for Savs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560455\"><a href=\"/opinion/560455/timberland-design-inc-and-william-c-barnsley-v-first-service-bank-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.1991);  La Rambla, 791 F.2d at 218.   Depositors then maintain their insured deposits, while borrowers continue to meet their obligations, allowing banking business to continue with some regularity</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> As to the existence of an insured deposit in this case, we cannot say, given the state of the record below, whether or to what extent we would be willing to follow the Eighth Circuit's holding in In re Collins Sec. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610983\"><a href=\"/opinion/610983/in-re-collins-securities-corporation-debtor-harvey-bell-trustee-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span>, 554-55 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that the FDIC is not liable in its corporate capacity because no account existed at the time of the bank's failure due to a non-fraudulent pre-failure bank error).  We merely point out to the parties that similar issues may arise on remand, along with possible jurisdictional issues.  See La Rambla, 791 F.2d at 220-21 (finding no jurisdictional basis under 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1819(b)(2)(D) or (E) for counterclaim against FDIC in its capacity as receiver)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Absent the crediting of the certificate of deposit toward Guaranty's indebtedness, the Commissioner would have been entitled to its proceeds either in his capacity as assignee, or in his capacity as Guaranty's receiver.  The FDIC does not object to the capacity in which the Commissioner now brings this appeal, and we therefore assume, without prejudice to the district court's ability to determine otherwise, that the Commissioner seeks recovery in his proper capacity</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Language on the reverse side of the certificate of deposit stated:</p>\n        <p>The assignment of this Certificate to a third party will not be considered valid until said transaction has been notified to, and accepted by the bank.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
