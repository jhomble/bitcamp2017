Gaynor, Assistant  United States Attorneys,  on brief for\n               \nappellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                       December 9, 1993\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.   Defendant-appellant  Ediberto Ramirez\n                    \n\npleaded guilty to  a two-count indictment which  charged him,\n\nafter having been convicted of a felony, with possession of a\n\nfirearm and of  ammunition, respectively, in violation  of 18\n\nU.S.C.    922(g).  The presentence investigation  report (PSI\n\nReport) stated that Ramirez was observed firing the weapon in\n\na   public  place.    Imposing  sentence  under  the  federal\n\nsentencing   guidelines  and   departing   upward  from   the\n\napplicable  guideline  sentencing range,  the  district court\n\nsentenced  appellant to a  37-month prison term  and a 3-year\n\nsupervised  release term.   The  court  further ordered  that\n\nappellant   be  remanded   to  the  custody   of  immigration\n\nauthorities  for deportation  proceedings  upon his  release.\n\nRamirez appeals from his sentence.  We affirm.\n\n                              A.\n                               \n\n          The PSI Report recommended that Ramirez be assigned\n\neleven  criminal history points  based on his  prior criminal\n\nconvictions and on the fact that the instant offense occurred\n\nwhile he  was under  a sentence of  probation for  a previous\n\noffense.  It then listed the following prior criminal conduct\n\nas an adult: three charges of assault with a dangerous weapon\n\n(once a broom handle, once a BB gun, and once a handgun), the\n\nlast of which is still pending; and one charge of driving  to\n\nendanger,  death  resulting  (associated  with  a  charge  of\n\npossessing a stolen  motor vehicle), which is  still pending.\n\nFinally,  the PSI Report listed two \"factors that may warrant\n\ndeparture\":      (1)  that   several  of   appellant's  prior\n\nconvictions were consolidated for sentencing, and as a result\n\nwere  \"undercounted\"  in  the  calculation  of  his  criminal\n\nhistory score,  and (2) that  the offense  of conviction  was\n\ncommitted while Ramirez was free on bail.\n\n          In announcing  its decision  to depart  upward, the\n\ndistrict court stated:\n\n          I have  reviewed the  pre-sentence report\n          and  considered  the  objections  of  the\n          defendant  to an  upward  departure.   It\n          seems to me  that this is a case in which\n          upward departure  is not  only justified,\n          it's required.   We have a  defendant who\n          is 19 years or so old, who has never  had\n          a  job so  far as  I can see,  whose sole\n          occupation  is   taking  other   people's\n          property  and  who   is  escalating  this\n          conduct from  assaulting somebody  with a\n          broomstick  to firing  a  firearm in  the\n          air, the carrying of a firearm.  It seems\n          to me the charge itself that he's here on\n          doesn't really  indicate the  seriousness\n          of the conduct  that's involved here  and\n          it  seems  to  me  that  the  computation\n          significantly     under-represents    the\n          seriousness of the  past criminal conduct\n          and the  likelihood of the  commission of\n          further crime in  the circumstance.  Here\n          the record pretty  fairly shows that  the\n          defendant   is   content   to  accomplish\n          nothing  but   violations  of   the  law.\n          Although  he  does  indicate  that he  is\n          sorry this happened, takes responsibility\n          for it, it's pretty clear to me that this\n          record  doesn't justify,  or this  record\n          results  in  under-representation.    I'm\n          going to depart\n          ---\n\n                            . . .\n\n                             -3-\n\n          You're 20 years old  and you've never had\n          a job and you tell me that you don't know\n          anything  about  earning  respect because\n          you haven't been  respected.  Your mother\n          has to  work  very hard  to support  you.\n          It's  about time  you  took  some of  the\n          responsibility for what you do.  It's not\n          the alcohol that drives  these cars away,\n          get into  accidents in  which people  get\n          killed.  Not the alcohol  that does that.\n          It's  not  the  alcohol  that steals  the\n          cars.   You're  apparently  not so  drunk\n          that  you can't steal a car and drive it.\n          It's  you  driving   the  car,  not   the\n          alcohol.   It's  you  stealing  and  then\n          escalating  the cars  one after  another.\n          It's  you  assaulting   somebody  with  a\n          broomstick  and then  a BB  gun  and then\n          finally  running  around  with  a  loaded\n          pistol  firing it in  the air.   It's not\n          the alcohol that's firing that gun.  It's\n          not the alcohol  that possesses that gun.\n          It's  you.  How many other people's lives\n          are in  jeopardy because  you don't  take\n          responsibility  for  what  you're  doing,\n          until push comes  to shove, until  you're\n          here and  you know  you're really  facing\n          some time,  you know you're  really going\n          to jail for  the first time.  I think you\n          need  some time  to think about  what the\n          future  of  your  life  is going  to  be,\n          really, really think about it.\n\n          The district  court, by  its reference  to the  PSI\n\nReport  in the  context  of elaborating  the  reasons for  an\n\nupward  departure,  appears  to have  based  its  decision to\n\ndepart, at  least in  part, on the  two possible  grounds for\n\ndeparture  suggested by the probation department.  On appeal,\n\nRamirez raises no objection  to either of those  two grounds.\n\nRather,  his  sole   challenge  on  appeal  is  to   what  he\n\ncharacterizes  as the  district  court's  decision to  depart\n\nupward on the basis of his prior arrest record.  \n\n                             -4-\n\n          His challenge  has two  prongs.   First, he  argues\n\nthat  an upward  departure on  the  basis of  a prior  arrest\n\nrecord is forbidden by U.S.S.G.   4A1.3, which states that \"a\n\nprior arrest  record itself shall  not be considered  under  \n\n4A1.3.\"  Second,  he argues that the district  court \"had not\n\nadequately  explained the factual basis  for its use of those\n\narrests as a ground for departure.\"\n\n                              B.\n                               \n\n            We  disagree with  Ramirez's characterization  of\n\nthe  district court's departure as impermissibly based on his\n\nprior arrest  record itself.   U.S.S.G.   4A1.3 states:   \"If\n\nreliable  information  indicates  that  the criminal  history\n\ncategory does not  adequately reflect the seriousness  of the\n\ndefendant's  past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the\n\ndefendant  will commit other  crimes, the court  may consider\n\nimposing a sentence  departing from the otherwise  applicable\n\nguideline range.   Such information  may include, but  is not\n\nlimited to, information concerning:  . . . (e)  prior similar\n\nadult  criminal   conduct  not   resulting   in  a   criminal\n\nconviction.\"  To be sure, the guideline goes on to state that\n\n\"a prior arrest  record itself shall  not be considered\"  for\n\nthis purpose.   But, so long as that  limitation is observed,\n\nprior similar adult criminal conduct  is a basis on which the\n\nSentencing  Commission  has \"encouraged\"  upward  departures.\n\nUnited States v.  Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 948  (1st Cir. 1993).\n                        \n\n                             -5-\n\nWe conclude  that the  district court's  upward departure  is\n\npermissible if it was made  on the basis of reliable evidence\n\nof  prior similar  adult criminal  conduct,  even though  the\n\nconduct  did  not  result,  or   had  not  yet  resulted,  in\n\nconvictions.\n\n                              C.\n                               \n\n          We   turn   next    to   whether   the   particular\n\ncircumstances cited by  the district court \"are of  a kind or\n\ndegree that they may appropriately be  relied upon to justify\n\ndeparture.\"   Id. at  950.  In  this instance,  that question\n                \n\nboils down to  whether the prior conduct is  \"similar\" to the\n\noffense of conviction, as required by U.S.S.G.   4A1.3(e).\n\n          The offense  of conviction, again, is possession of\n\na firearm, under circumstances in which Ramirez, in  a public\n\nplace, discharged  the firearm  in the  air.  The  similarity\n\nbetween this offense  and appellant's  prior alleged  conduct\n\ninvolving  assault with  a  broom  handle, a  BB  gun, and  a\n\nhandgun, -- possession  and/or threatened use of  a dangerous\n\nweapon -- is  clear.  See United States v.  Tabares, 951 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n405,  411  (1st  Cir.  1991)  (assuming  that  prior  conduct\n\ninvolving possession of a dangerous weapon and assault with a\n\ndeadly weapon was similar to possession of a firearm); United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Cota-Guerrero,  907  F.2d 87,  89 (9th  Cir. 1990)\n                        \n\n(\"Inasmuch as they  show a propensity  toward violence and  a\n\nwillingness to use force, these crimes [assault with a deadly\n\n                             -6-\n\nweapon and assault  and battery] may be viewed  as similar to\n\npossession of a firearm by a felon\").\n\n          The similarity between the  instant firearm offense\n\nand  the  prior   conduct  of  driving  to   endanger,  death\n\nresulting, is  less obvious.   Nevertheless, we find  -- with\n\nappropriate respect  for the district court's superior \"feel\"\n\nfor the  particular circumstances  of the  case, Rivera,  994\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at  951-52 --  that, at  least  under the  circumstances\n\npresent here, the offenses are sufficiently \"similar\" to form\n\npart  of  the  justification for  an  upward  departure under\n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.3.\n\n          The  district   court  stated   clearly  that   its\n\nparamount  concern  was  appellant's record  of  \"escalating\"\n\nrecidivism --  a pattern of  conduct suggesting to  the court\n\nthat Ramirez did  not care \"[h]ow  many other people's  lives\n\nare  in jeopardy\" because Ramirez did not take responsibility\n\nfor  his own  acts.   Appellant's  prior  alleged conduct  of\n\ndriving  to  endanger,  death  resulting,  like  the  instant\n\nfirearms  offense, displays  a  reckless indifference  toward\n\nhuman life.   The  two crimes  can, therefore,  reasonably be\n\nviewed, at  least under  present circumstances,  as \"similar\"\n\noffenses.  Cf.  United States v.  Moore, 931  F.2d 3, 4  (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1991) (treating as \"similar\" offenses that \"reveal . . .\n\nthe same  sort of  dishonesty and  misappropriation of  other\n\npeople's property\").\n\n                             -7-\n\n                              D.\n                               \n\n          The remaining question  -- since appellant has  not\n\nchallenged the \"degree\" of departure, see Rivera, 994 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n950 -- is whether \"the evidence . . . supports the departure-\n\nrelated findings  of fact.\"   Id.   In  other words,  did the\n                                \n\ndistrict court base  its ruling on \"reliable  information\" of\n\n\"prior  similar adult  criminal conduct  not  resulting in  a\n\ncriminal  conviction\"  that  indicates  \"that  the   criminal\n\nhistory category does not adequately  reflect the seriousness\n\nof  the defendant's past  criminal conduct or  the likelihood\n\nthat the  defendant will  commit other  crimes\"?   U.S.S.G.  \n\n4A1.3.  We think this query merits an affirmative answer.    \n\n          In  Tabares, 951  F.2d 405,  we  upheld a  district\n                     \n\ncourt's upward departure on the basis of three prior criminal\n\ncharges  (possession of a  dangerous weapon and  two assaults\n\nwith a deadly weapon)  that had not resulted in  convictions.\n\nAll  three prior  charges  had  been  dismissed  for  reasons\n\nunrelated to the merits.  We determined that the PSI Report's\n\naccount  of  these  prior  instances  constituted   \"reliable\n\ninformation\" to support an upward departure.  Id. at 411.  In\n                                                 \n\nthe process,  we noted  specifically defendant's  \"failure to\n\ncontest   the  facts  and  the  absence  of  any  acquittal,\"\n\ncircumstances  that  left  little  \"doubt  that   these  acts\n\noccurred.\"  Id.;  see also United States v.  Torres, 977 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n                             -8-\n\n321, 330 (7th Cir. 1992) (observing that, \"[w]hen a defendant\n\nhas  an opportunity  to and  fails  to object  to the  facts,\n\ninformation, and records used to support a departure [on  the\n\nbasis  of prior  similar adult  criminal  conduct], there  is\n\nlittle  reason  to question  a  district court's  decision\");\n\nUnited States  v. Gaddy,  909 F.2d 196,  201 (7th  Cir. 1990)\n                       \n\n(similar).\n\n          These authorities  get the  grease from  the goose.\n\nIn this  case, the  PSI Report  contains descriptions,  taken\n\nfrom the original case files, of the conduct that led to each\n\nof the prior charges.  In this case, as in Tabares, appellant\n                                                  \n\nreceived  a full opportunity to object to these descriptions,\n\nand  he raised  no objections.   The  district court  plainly\n\nrelied  on these  descriptive accounts  of appellant's  prior\n\nconduct, not on the  mere fact of prior arrests.   And, there\n\ncan be no question of  the seriousness of the conduct alleged\n\nin these  charges.   Under the same  reasoning we  applied in\n\nTabares,  therefore,  we  find that  the  evidence  of record\n       \n\nadequately supports an upward departure on the basis of prior\n\nsimilar adult criminal conduct.\n\n                              E.\n                               \n\n         Turning to  appellant's final  argument --  that the\n\ndistrict court did  not adequately explain the  factual basis\n\nfor its use of the prior charges as a ground for departure --\n\nwe acknowledge that the court's discussion of its reasons for\n\n                             -9-\n\ndeparture might, in  one respect, fall slightly short  of the\n\nrequirements set forth in Rivera, 994 F.2d 942.  The district\n                                \n\ncourt's  remarks leave some ambiguity about whether the court\n\nrelied,  at least  in part,  on  the two  grounds for  upward\n\ndeparture recited  in the  PSI Report.   In other  words, the\n\ndistrict court did  not expressly explain its  reasoning with\n\nregard  to those two  grounds.   Appellant, however,  has not\n\nchallenged the  district court's use of these grounds, so any\n\nerror is necessarily harmless.\n\n          As  to the remaining ground for departure, based on\n\nappellant's prior  alleged  criminal  conduct,  the  district\n\ncourt did  set forth its  reasoning in adequate detail.   The\n\ncourt  explained its  concern  that  the  guideline  sentence\n\nunderstated   the  potential   for  \"escalating\"   recidivism\n\nsuggested   by  appellant's  prior  conduct.

Defendant-appellant  Ediberto Ramirez\n                    \n\npleaded guilty to  a two-count indictment which  charged him,\n\nafter having been convicted of a felony, with possession of a\n\nfirearm and of  ammunition, respectively, in violation  of 18\n\nU.S.C.    922(g).  The presentence investigation  report (PSI\n\nReport) stated that Ramirez was observed firing the weapon in\n\na   public  place.    Imposing  sentence  under  the  federal\n\nsentencing   guidelines  and   departing   upward  from   the\n\napplicable  guideline  sentencing range,  the  district court\n\nsentenced  appellant to a  37-month prison term  and a 3-year\n\nsupervised  release term.   The  court  further ordered  that\n\nappellant   be  remanded   to  the  custody   of  immigration\n\nauthorities  for deportation  proceedings  upon his  release.\n\nRamirez appeals from his sentence.  We affirm.\n\n                              A.\n                               \n\n          The PSI Report recommended that Ramirez be assigned\n\neleven  criminal history points  based on his  prior criminal\n\nconvictions and on the fact that the instant offense occurred\n\nwhile he  was under  a sentence of  probation for  a previous\n\noffense.  It then listed the following prior criminal conduct\n\nas an adult: three charges of assault with a dangerous weapon\n\n(once a broom handle, once a BB gun, and once a handgun), the\n\nlast of which is still pending; and one charge of driving  to\n\nendanger,  death  resulting  (associated  with  a  charge  of\n\npossessing a stolen  motor vehicle), which is  still pending.\n\nFinally,  the PSI Report listed two \"factors that may warrant\n\ndeparture\":      (1)  that   several  of   appellant's  prior\n\nconvictions were consolidated for sentencing, and as a result\n\nwere  \"undercounted\"  in  the  calculation  of  his  criminal\n\nhistory score,  and (2) that  the offense  of conviction  was\n\ncommitted while Ramirez was free on bail.\n\n          In announcing  its decision  to depart  upward, the\n\ndistrict court stated:\n\n          I have  reviewed the  pre-sentence report\n          and  considered  the  objections  of  the\n          defendant  to an  upward  departure.   It\n          seems to me  that this is a case in which\n          upward departure  is not  only justified,\n          it's required.   We have a  defendant who\n          is 19 years or so old, who has never  had\n          a  job so  far as  I can see,  whose sole\n          occupation  is   taking  other   people's\n          property  and  who   is  escalating  this\n          conduct from  assaulting somebody  with a\n          broomstick  to firing  a  firearm in  the\n          air, the carrying of a firearm.  It seems\n          to me the charge itself that he's here on\n          doesn't really  indicate the  seriousness\n          of the conduct  that's involved here  and\n          it  seems  to  me  that  the  computation\n          significantly     under-represents    the\n          seriousness of the  past criminal conduct\n          and the  likelihood of the  commission of\n          further crime in  the circumstance.  Here\n          the record pretty  fairly shows that  the\n          defendant   is   content   to  accomplish\n          nothing  but   violations  of   the  law.\n          Although  he  does  indicate  that he  is\n          sorry this happened, takes responsibility\n          for it, it's pretty clear to me that this\n          record  doesn't justify,  or this  record\n          results  in  under-representation.    I'm\n          going to depart\n          ---\n\n                            . . .\n\n                             -3-\n\n          You're 20 years old  and you've never had\n          a job and you tell me that you don't know\n          anything  about  earning  respect because\n          you haven't been  respected.  Your mother\n          has to  work  very hard  to support  you.\n          It's  about time  you  took  some of  the\n          responsibility for what you do.  It's not\n          the alcohol that drives  these cars away,\n          get into  accidents in  which people  get\n          killed.  Not the alcohol  that does that.\n          It's  not  the  alcohol  that steals  the\n          cars.   You're  apparently  not so  drunk\n          that  you can't steal a car and drive it.\n          It's  you  driving   the  car,  not   the\n          alcohol.   It's  you  stealing  and  then\n          escalating  the cars  one after  another.\n          It's  you  assaulting   somebody  with  a\n          broomstick  and then  a BB  gun  and then\n          finally  running  around  with  a  loaded\n          pistol  firing it in  the air.   It's not\n          the alcohol that's firing that gun.  It's\n          not the alcohol  that possesses that gun.\n          It's  you.  How many other people's lives\n          are in  jeopardy because  you don't  take\n          responsibility  for  what  you're  doing,\n          until push comes  to shove, until  you're\n          here and  you know  you're really  facing\n          some time,  you know you're  really going\n          to jail for  the first time.  I think you\n          need  some time  to think about  what the\n          future  of  your  life  is going  to  be,\n          really, really think about it.\n\n          The district  court, by  its reference  to the  PSI\n\nReport  in the  context  of elaborating  the  reasons for  an\n\nupward  departure,  appears  to have  based  its  decision to\n\ndepart, at  least in  part, on the  two possible  grounds for\n\ndeparture  suggested by the probation department.  On appeal,\n\nRamirez raises no objection  to either of those  two grounds.\n\nRather,  his  sole   challenge  on  appeal  is  to   what  he\n\ncharacterizes  as the  district  court's  decision to  depart\n\nupward on the basis of his prior arrest record.  \n\n                             -4-\n\n          His challenge  has two  prongs.   First, he  argues\n\nthat  an upward  departure on  the  basis of  a prior  arrest\n\nrecord is forbidden by U.S.S.G.   4A1.3, which states that \"a\n\nprior arrest  record itself shall  not be considered  under  \n\n4A1.3.\"  Second,  he argues that the district  court \"had not\n\nadequately  explained the factual basis  for its use of those\n\narrests as a ground for departure.\"\n\n                              B.\n                               \n\n            We  disagree with  Ramirez's characterization  of\n\nthe  district court's departure as impermissibly based on his\n\nprior arrest  record itself.   U.S.S.G.   4A1.3 states:   \"If\n\nreliable  information  indicates  that  the criminal  history\n\ncategory does not  adequately reflect the seriousness  of the\n\ndefendant's  past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the\n\ndefendant  will commit other  crimes, the court  may consider\n\nimposing a sentence  departing from the otherwise  applicable\n\nguideline range.   Such information  may include, but  is not\n\nlimited to, information concerning:  . . . (e)  prior similar\n\nadult  criminal   conduct  not   resulting   in  a   criminal\n\nconviction.\"  To be sure, the guideline goes on to state that\n\n\"a prior arrest  record itself shall  not be considered\"  for\n\nthis purpose.   But, so long as that  limitation is observed,\n\nprior similar adult criminal conduct  is a basis on which the\n\nSentencing  Commission  has \"encouraged\"  upward  departures.\n\nUnited States v.

In  this instance,  that question\n                \n\nboils down to  whether the prior conduct is  \"similar\" to the\n\noffense of conviction, as required by U.S.S.G.   4A1.3(e).\n\n          The offense  of conviction, again, is possession of\n\na firearm, under circumstances in which Ramirez, in  a public\n\nplace, discharged  the firearm  in the  air.  The  similarity\n\nbetween this offense  and appellant's  prior alleged  conduct\n\ninvolving  assault with  a  broom  handle, a  BB  gun, and  a\n\nhandgun, -- possession  and/or threatened use of  a dangerous\n\nweapon -- is  clear.

Appellant's  prior  alleged conduct  of\n\ndriving  to  endanger,  death  resulting,  like  the  instant\n\nfirearms  offense, displays  a  reckless indifference  toward\n\nhuman life.

In this case, as in Tabares, appellant\n                                                  \n\nreceived  a full opportunity to object to these descriptions,\n\nand  he raised  no objections.   The  district court  plainly\n\nrelied  on these  descriptive accounts  of appellant's  prior\n\nconduct, not on the  mere fact of prior arrests.   And, there\n\ncan be no question of  the seriousness of the conduct alleged\n\nin these  charges.   Under the same  reasoning we  applied in\n\nTabares,  therefore,  we  find that  the  evidence  of record\n       \n\nadequately supports an upward departure on the basis of prior\n\nsimilar adult criminal conduct.\n\n                              E.\n                               \n\n         Turning to  appellant's final  argument --  that the\n\ndistrict court did  not adequately explain the  factual basis\n\nfor its use of the prior charges as a ground for departure --\n\nwe acknowledge that the court's discussion of its reasons for\n\n                             -9-\n\ndeparture might, in  one respect, fall slightly short  of the\n\nrequirements set forth in Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  The district\n                                \n\ncourt's  remarks leave some ambiguity about whether the court\n\nrelied,  at least  in part,  on  the two  grounds for  upward\n\ndeparture recited  in the  PSI Report.   In other  words, the\n\ndistrict court did  not expressly explain its  reasoning with\n\nregard  to those two  grounds.   Appellant, however,  has not\n\nchallenged the  district court's use of these grounds, so any\n\nerror is necessarily harmless.\n\n          As  to the remaining ground for departure, based on\n\nappellant's prior  alleged  criminal  conduct,  the  district\n\ncourt did  set forth its  reasoning in adequate detail.   The\n\ncourt  explained its  concern  that  the  guideline  sentence\n\nunderstated   the  potential   for  \"escalating\"   recidivism\n\nsuggested   by  appellant's  prior  conduct.    No  more  was\n\nexigible.1\n\n                              F.\n                               \n\n          We need go no further.  On this record, appellant's\n\nsentence was lawfully constructed and imposed.\n\n                    \n\n1.  Even if we assume, arguendo,  that the district court did\n                               \nnot  adequately  explain  its   analysis  under  the   Rivera\n                                                             \nstandard,  we are mindful that appellant was sentenced before\nthis court  decided Rivera.   We have recognized  that Rivera\n                                                             \nlooked  to the future:  \"In future  cases we would expect, in\nline with our general discussion in Rivera, a very deliberate\n                                          \ndiscussion of  the factors making  the case unusual.   But we\nsee no purpose served in this case, decided below without the\nbenefit of our recent guidance, in remanding to make explicit\nwhat was implicit.\"   United States v.
