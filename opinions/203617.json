Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n              Howard, Baldock*, and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Martin J. Vogelbaum, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for\nappellant.\n     Randall E. Kromm, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                            January 9, 2009\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.        Appellant Derek Graham was on\n\nprobation in Massachusetts for various drug offenses.               When he\n\nfailed to comply with probation reporting requirements, the police\n\nsecured a warrant for his arrest.            To execute this warrant,\n\nofficers entered an apartment, and, after finding Graham in one of\n\nthe apartment's bedrooms, they arrested him and searched the room.\n\nThe search yielded a sawed-off shotgun and ammunition.          Based on\n\nthis evidence, a federal grand jury charged Graham with being a\n\nfelon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1).\n\n           Graham sought to suppress the evidence, arguing that the\n\npolice   violated   the   Fourth   Amendment    of   the   United    States\n\nConstitution in acquiring it.      After the district court resolved\n\nthe suppression motion against Graham, he entered a conditional\n\nguilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the suppression ruling.\n\nHe now exercises that right.\n\n           Graham argues that both the officers' entry into the\n\napartment and the subsequent search of the bedroom where he was\n\narrested violated the Fourth Amendment.        He claims that because he\n\nwas a social guest in the apartment, the police needed to first\n\nobtain a search warrant to enter the apartment, in addition to the\n\narrest warrant they had procured.         Additionally, he argues that\n\neven if the arrest warrant justified the entry into the apartment,\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthe police still needed a search warrant to conduct the search of\n\nthe bedroom.\n\n            In response, the government argues that the entry by the\n\nofficers was permitted under the rule of Payton v. New York, 445\n\nU.S. 573 (1980), because they had a warrant for Graham's arrest,\n\nand they reasonably believed prior to entry that Graham resided at\n\nthe apartment.    As for the subsequent search of the bedroom, the\n\ngovernment submits that the search was justified as either a valid\n\nprobation search or a search incident to arrest.         We affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n                              A. Background\n\n            We state the relevant facts as the trial court found\n\nthem, consistent with record support.         United States v. Ruidiaz,\n\n529 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            After committing various drug offenses, Derek Graham was\n\nsentenced   to   probation   by   a   Massachusetts   state   court.   The\n\nprobation order, issued in mid-October 2004, required Graham to\n\ncomply with several standard conditions.        The order also included\n\nthe following search condition:\n\n            On the basis of a reasonable suspicion that a\n            condition of the probationer's probation has\n            been violated, a probation officer, or any law\n            enforcement officer acting on the request of\n            the   probation   office,   may   search   the\n            probationer's property, his or her residence,\n            and any place where he or she may be living,\n            and may do so with or without a search\n            warrant, depending on the requirements of law.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f          Graham signed the probation order, indicating that he had\n\nread and understood the conditions of probation.\n\n          Although on probation for drug offenses, Graham had\n\npreviously pled guilty to possessing firearms illegally, and the\n\npolice connected him with a violent gang in his neighborhood known\n\nas the Crown Path Gang.      This gang had an ongoing rivalry with a\n\ngang from a neighboring area known as the Everton Young Guns.\n\n          Graham fell out of compliance with the probation order in\n\nlate-October    2004,     failing    to     meet     the   order's      reporting\n\nrequirements. As a result, Graham's probation officer, Thomas Todd\n\n(Todd), sought and obtained a warrant for his arrest.                         Todd\n\nunderstood Graham to be living with his mother in Dorchester,\n\nMassachusetts. The police attempted to execute the warrant at this\n\nlocation but did not find him there.\n\n          Over the next few months, Todd learned that Graham had\n\npotentially    violated    another    one    of     the    conditions    of    his\n\nprobation, this one requiring him to obey all local, state, and\n\nfederal laws.    Specifically, another probationer told Todd that\n\nGraham had \"brandished a weapon on him\" and a member of the Everton\n\nYoung Guns told Todd that the gang suspected Graham was responsible\n\nfor several shootings of their members.\n\n          At first unable to locate Graham, in time the authorities\n\nbegan to hone in on his whereabouts.               In May 2005, Todd learned\n\nfrom another probation officer that Graham had been \"staying at\" a\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fhouse on the corner of Harvard Street and Harvard Park.                   The\n\naddress of this building was 18 Harvard Street.           After receiving\n\nthe tip, Todd drove by the house.        He recalled having previously\n\nseen another member of the Crown Path Gang on the house's porch.\n\nTodd provided the Boston Police Department with this information.\n\nThe police then informed Todd of a report of a domestic incident at\n\n18 Harvard Street, identifying Graham as the offender.           The report\n\nstated that Chanice Meadows (Chanice) alleged that she had been\n\nthreatened by her daughter's boyfriend, Derek Graham.           The report\n\nlisted Graham's address as 18 Harvard Street.\n\n            Based on this information, a magistrate added the 18\n\nHarvard Street address to the arrest warrant for Graham.                 Todd\n\nagain contacted the Boston Police Department and requested that the\n\nwarrant be executed. Todd informed the police that Graham might be\n\narmed, that Graham was subject to a probation search condition, and\n\nthat   a   probation   officer   would   be   available   to   perform    the\n\nprobation search if Graham were found.         The police informed Todd\n\nthat the warrant would be executed the next day, a Saturday.\n\n            Around 7 a.m. on Saturday morning, police officers went\n\nto 18 Harvard Street with the arrest warrant.              They showed a\n\npicture of Graham to the person who answered the door and were\n\ndirected to the third-floor apartment.         Chanice answered the door\n\nto the apartment but denied that Graham was present.           The officers\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\finformed Chanice that they had a warrant and entered the apartment\n\nto look for Graham.\n\n           They discovered Graham in the apartment's rear bedroom.\n\nThe officers noticed a number of items in the room, including men's\n\nclothes on the floor and in a duffel bag, several boxes of shoes\n\nagainst a wall, men's toiletries on a bureau next to a bed, and a\n\nnewspaper clipping and several pictures on a wall in the room.           The\n\nnewspaper clipping concerned the murder of a member of the Everton\n\nYoung Guns -- the Crown Path Gang's rival gang -- and the pictures\n\nwere of individuals making hand-signs associated with the Crown\n\nPath Gang.\n\n           The officers arrested Graham, handcuffed him, and brought\n\nhim to the living room, which was in the front of the apartment.\n\nThey then contacted the probation officer on duty, who arrived at\n\nthe   apartment   fifteen    minutes   later   with    copies   of   Graham's\n\nprobation documents.       The probation officer asked the officers to\n\nsearch the bedroom where Graham was found.            In the course of this\n\nsearch, the police found a sawed off shotgun and ammunition in the\n\ndrawer of a dresser.        The officers also discovered a small safe\n\nunderneath the bed.    Using a knife, an officer opened the safe and\n\ndiscovered various types of ammunition.\n\n                      B.    State court proceeding\n\n           Massachusetts charged Graham with possession of a shotgun\n\nand ammunition in violation of state law. Graham moved to suppress\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fthe evidence. After a suppression hearing, the state court granted\n\nGraham's motion.\n\n           The state court concluded that the officers' entry into\n\nthe apartment was justified under Payton because the officers\n\nreasonably believed that Graham resided at the apartment.                           The\n\ncourt, however, determined that the subsequent search of the room\n\nwhere   Graham   was        found    violated        Graham's    rights   under     the\n\nMassachusetts     Declaration             of     Rights   in     the   Massachusetts\n\nconstitution.         The    court    explained        that     article   14   of   the\n\nMassachusetts constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt of Massachusetts in Commonwealth v. LaFrance, 525 N.E.2d 379\n\n(1988), barred probation searches executed without a search warrant\n\nunless \"one of the established exceptions to [the search warrant]\n\nrequirement\" applied.          Finding that no such exception applied in\n\nGraham's case, the state court suppressed the evidence.1\n\n                 C.    Federal district court proceeding\n\n           Subsequent        to     the    state     court's    resolution     of   the\n\nsuppression issue, the United States charged Graham in federal\n\ncourt with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.\n\n           Like the state court, the federal court concluded that\n\nthe police entry into the apartment was permissible under Payton.\n\nThe court ruled in the alternative that the probation order itself\n\n\n1\n  Although a search incident to arrest is an established exception\nto the warrant requirement, state prosecutors did not argue that\nthe evidence was seized as a result of a search incident to arrest.\n\n                                               -7-\n\fallowed the officers to enter the apartment.     Unlike the state\n\ncourt, however, the district court concluded that the police did\n\nnot need a search warrant to search the room where Graham was\n\nfound.\n\n          The district court determined that the police collected\n\nthe evidence from the bedroom pursuant to a valid probation search.\n\nRelying on United States v. Knights, 534 U.S. 112 (2001) and Samson\n\nv. California, 547 U.S. 843 (2006), two cases analyzing warrantless\n\nsearches of defendants on conditional release,2 the court concluded\n\nthat as a probationer, Graham had such a reduced expectation of\n\nprivacy that a warrantless search was reasonable under the Fourth\n\nAmendment.   The court rejected Graham's argument that the search\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment because the police, in defiance of\n\nstate law, failed to obtain a search warrant. The court determined\n\ninstead that the admissibility of evidence in a federal proceeding\n\nis governed solely by federal law, and federal law did not require\n\na search warrant.\n\n          The court also stated that an alternative basis for\n\nupholding the search, viz., that it was a valid search incident to\n\narrest.   Although Graham had been handcuffed and removed from the\n\nroom prior to the search, the court determined that the areas\n\n\n\n\n2\n Probation, parole and supervised release are forms of conditional\nrelease. United States v. Weikert, 504 F.3d 1, 7 n.4 (1st Cir.\n2007).\n\n                                -8-\n\fsearched and   items seized were within his reach at the time of his\n\narrest.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          When reviewing the disposition of a suppression ruling,\n\nwe review the district court's factual findings for clear error and\n\nits ultimate constitutional conclusion de novo.           United States v.\n\nNascimento, 491 F.3d 25, 50 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                   A.   The entry into the apartment\n\n          Graham    first   challenges    the   initial   entry   into   his\n\napartment, understanding that if we find this entry unjustified the\n\nevidence discovered subsequent to it must be suppressed.            Graham\n\ncontends that because he did not \"reside\" at the apartment, because\n\nhe was merely an overnight guest, the police needed a search\n\nwarrant in order to enter the apartment, in addition to the arrest\n\nwarrant that they procured.    He also argues that the entry into the\n\napartment was not permissible under Payton, because the officers\n\ndid not \"reasonably believe\" that he resided in the apartment. The\n\ngovernment disagrees, contending that the arrest warrant itself,\n\ncoupled with evidence supporting a reasonable belief that Graham\n\nresided in the apartment, was sufficient under Payton to permit\n\nentry into the apartment.\n\n          Payton is the lodestar.        In that case, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that police armed with an arrest warrant for a suspect founded\n\non probable cause may enter the dwelling of that suspect when\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f\"there is reason to believe [he] is within.\"              445 U.S. at 602.\n\nSubsequent to Payton, courts have held that even where it is\n\ndiscovered after entry that the dwelling is not the suspect's, the\n\ninitial entry may be justified under Payton provided the police\n\nreasonably believed, prior to entry, that the suspect did reside at\n\nthe dwelling.   United States v. Lovelock, 170 F.3d 339, 343-44 (2d\n\nCir. 1999) (observing that although Payton requires that the\n\nentering officers reasonably believe that the subject of the arrest\n\nwarrant   resides   at   the    place   entered,   that   belief   need   not\n\nultimately be correct);        United States v. Risse, 83 F.3d 212, 216\n\n(8th Cir. 1996) (\"The officers' assessment need not in fact be\n\ncorrect; rather, they need only 'reasonably believe' that the\n\nsuspect resides at the dwelling to be searched and is currently\n\npresent at the dwelling.\") (citations omitted)); United States v.\n\nRoute, 104 F.3d 59, 63 (5th Cir. 1997) (same).\n\n           Whether Graham actually \"resided\" at the apartment, then,\n\nis not dispositive so long as the police \"reasonably believed\"\n\nprior to entry that he (1) resided at the apartment and (2) would\n\nbe present.   See United States v. Weems, 322 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (citing Unites States v. Gay, 240 F.3d 1222, 1226-27 (10th\n\nCir. 2001), for the proposition that \"Payton allows entry because\n\nofficers had a reasonable belief that subject of arrest warrant\n\nlived at the house they entered\")); see also United States v.\n\nThomas, 429 F.3d 282, 286 (D.C. Cir. 2005).         At issue in this case\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fis whether the police had a \"reasonable belief of residence,\" and\n\nnot the second requirement, whether they had \"reason to believe\"\n\nGraham was within the apartment when they entered.\n\n           In    determining     whether   the     officers     possessed     a\n\nreasonable belief that Graham resided at the apartment, we examine\n\nthe basis for that belief.        United States v. Bervaldi, 226 F.3d\n\n1256, 1263 (11th Cir. 2000) (examining \"the facts and circumstances\n\nwithin the knowledge of law enforcement agents . . . viewed in the\n\ntotality\") (citation omitted)); Lovelock, 170 F.3d at 343.                    Of\n\ncourse, certain facts will almost always give rise to a reasonable\n\nbelief that the subject of an arrest warrant resides at the place\n\nentered.   For example, in United States v. Route police concluded\n\nthat the subject of the arrest warrant resided at the house entered\n\nbecause    his   credit   card     applications,     utility      bill,     car\n\nregistration, and mail were directed to the house.            104 F.3d 59, 62\n\nnn.1 & 63 (5th Cir. 1997).        However, the police need not posses\n\nsuch   rock-solid   indicators    of   residence    in   order    to   form    a\n\n\"reasonable belief\" that a suspect resides at a given place.\n\n           Two cases from the Eighth Circuit, United States v.\n\nClayton, 210 F.3d 841 (8th Cir. 2000) and United States v. Risse,\n\n83 F.3d 212 (8th Cir. 1996), are instructive.         In Clayton, a police\n\nrecord indicated that the defendant resided in a particular house.\n\n210 F.3d at 842-43.   Officers were also told by an anonymous caller\n\nthat the defendant resided at this house and were told by a person\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fleaving the house, immediately prior to their entry, that the\n\ndefendant was inside.        The Eighth Circuit concluded that this\n\ninformation \"gave police a reasonable belief that Clayton lived at\n\nthe residence.\"     Id. at 844.   In Risse, the subject of the arrest\n\nwarrant told police that she was \"staying\" at a certain place and\n\nthat officers could contact her there.         83 F.3d at 214-15.       A\n\nconfidential informant further told police that the subject was\n\n\"living\" at the same place with another person, and police had been\n\nunable to contact the subject at a different, permanent residence\n\nshe maintained.       Id. at 215.     The court concluded that this\n\ninformation supported a reasonable belief of residence.           Id. at\n\n216-17; see also Case v. Kitsap County Sheriff's Dep't, 249 F.3d\n\n921   (9th   Cir.   2001)   (discussing   information   giving   rise   to\n\nreasonable belief); Lovelock, 170 F.3d at 343 (same).\n\n             Similarly, we can safely conclude here that the police\n\npossessed a reasonable belief that Graham resided at the apartment.\n\nThe police based their residence determination on five pieces of\n\ninformation.     First, they possessed a police report describing a\n\ndomestic incident that occurred at the apartment.            The report\n\nlisted Graham as the offender and, critically, listed the apartment\n\nas Graham's address.        Second, another probationer told Todd,\n\nGraham's probation officer, that Graham was \"staying at\" the\n\napartment.     See Risse, 83 F.3d at 216-17 (noting police could\n\nreasonably interpret colloquial phrase \"staying with\" to mean\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f\"living with\"); see also Lovelock, 170 F.3d at 344.             Third,\n\nimmediately prior to entering the apartment, officers showed a\n\npicture of Graham to a person outside the apartment who pointed the\n\nofficers towards the apartment. Fourth, Todd, on a prior occasion,\n\nsaw a member of the gang Graham was associated with on the porch of\n\nthe apartment.     Fifth, officers had been unable to locate Graham\n\nwhere previously he had been living.       See Risse, 83 F.3d at 217\n\n(noting that police's inability to locate subject of arrest warrant\n\nat a location previously associated with the subject could support\n\na reasonable belief that subject was residing at a different\n\nlocation). Taken together, this information supported a reasonable\n\nbelief that Graham resided in the apartment.\n\n          In     challenging   this   conclusion,   Graham   criticizes\n\nindividually each piece of information the officers relied on in\n\nforming their belief.     But, as established above, we examine the\n\ninformation known to the officers in the totality and not in\n\nisolation.     See Lovelock, 170 F.3d at 344 (rejecting defendant's\n\nargument that police did not possess reasonable belief of residence\n\nwhere defendant sought to \"segment, isolate, and minimize each item\n\nof evidence that contributed to the existence and reasonableness of\n\nthe officers' belief\").\n\n          Graham also points to a litany of facts to support his\n\ncontention that he did not reside at the apartment.      He notes that\n\nhe did not have a key to the premises, that his clothing was on the\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\ffloor and in a duffle bag and not put away in closets and dressers,\n\nthat he had decorated the bedroom with only a few photos and a news\n\nclipping, and that both his shotgun and the safe where he kept his\n\nammunition were \"readily portable items.\"             This Monday-morning\n\nquarterbacking does nothing to assist our analysis.                  What the\n\npolice discovered after they entered the apartment cannot help us\n\ndetermine what the officers could have reasonably believed before\n\nentering the apartment.      Based on the reasoning provided above, we\n\nconclude that the officers were justified in believing Graham\n\nresided at the apartment.\n\n            Graham also argues that Payton does not determine the\n\noutcome here, but rather two other Supreme Court cases, Steagald v.\n\nUnited States, 451 U.S. 204 (1981) and Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S.\n\n91 (1990), should govern the analysis.\n\n            This argument is easily dismissed.          Steagald and Olson\n\nmerely     establish,   as   relevant     to   this   case,   that    certain\n\nindividuals have standing to object to a warrantless entry and\n\nsearch.3    Those cases did not establish that those challenges would\n\n\n3\n  In Steagald, the police, armed with an arrest warrant for a man\nnamed Ricky Lyons, entered a home \"based on their belief that []\nLyons might be a guest there.\" 451 U.S. at 213. On these facts,\nthe Supreme Court concluded that the defendant, Gary Steagald, a\nresident of the house who was not named in the arrest warrant,\ncould challenge the police's failure to obtain a search warrant\nprior to entering the residence to search for Lyons. See id. at\n223.   In Olson, the police entered a home for the purpose of\narresting Olson, the defendant. 495 U.S. at 94.        The police\npossessed neither an arrest warrant nor a search warrant and did\nnot claim to possess a reasonable belief that Olson resided at the\n\n                                   -14-\n\fnecessarily be successful where police entered a premises with both\n\na warrant for an individual's arrest and a reasonable belief that\n\nthe individual resided at the premises entered.              In such a case,\n\nPayton permits entry for the limited purpose of arresting the\n\nsubject of the arrest warrant.            See Bervaldi, 226 F.3d      at 1267\n\nn.11 (where police \"had a reasonable belief\" that the subject of\n\nthe arrest warrant resided at the place entered \"Payton, not\n\nSteagald,    applies\");       Pruitt,    458   F.3d   at   487-88   (rejecting\n\ndefendant's argument that Olson required a search warrant where\n\npolice possessed both an arrest warrant and the reasonable belief\n\nthat the subject of the arrest warrant resided at the place\n\nentered).4 Here, as established above, Payton's dictates permitted\n\nthe police to enter the apartment for the purpose of arresting\n\nGraham.\n\n                         B.   The search of the room\n\n            That   the    officers      were   justified    in   entering   the\n\napartment does not, however, resolve the issue of whether the\n\n\n\nhome.   See id..   The Supreme Court determined that Olson, an\novernight guest, had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his\nhost's home and thus could challenge the warrantless entry under\nthe Fourth Amendment. Id. at 100.\n4\n  In addition to arguing that Payton permits officers to enter a\nplace for the purpose of arresting the subject of an arrest\nwarrant, the government contends that Graham (a non-resident)\ncannot even raise a Steagald claim. Both the Supreme Court and\nthis court have left this question open, see Steagald, 451 U.S. at\n219; Weems, 322 F.3d at 23 n.3, and we have no need to resolve it\ntoday.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fevidence should have been suppressed.             Although the officers\n\npossessed a valid arrest warrant, this warrant only permitted them\n\nto seize Graham and did not, standing alone, authorize the search\n\nof the bedroom where Graham was found.           It is this search that\n\nyielded the bounty of evidence that the government introduced\n\nagainst Graham.\n\n          The government advances two theories to justify the\n\nwarrantless search.    First, it argues that the search was a valid\n\nprobation search.     The government notes that Graham signed a\n\nprobation order that allowed law enforcement to search \"any place\n\n[the probationer may be living]\" if the authorities had reasonable\n\nsuspicion that Graham had violated a condition of his probation.\n\nSecond, the government contends that even if the search was not a\n\nvalid probation search, it was a lawful search incident to arrest.\n\n          Graham    asserts   that    neither   theory   of   admissibility\n\nwithstands scrutiny. He contends that the search, in order qualify\n\nas a valid probation search, needed to be conducted pursuant to a\n\nsearch warrant. This is because (1) the Massachusetts constitution\n\nrequires the police, absent a \"traditional\" exception to the\n\nwarrant requirement, to obtain a search warrant prior to executing\n\na probation search and (2) the probation order informed him of the\n\nsearch warrant requirement.     Graham also disputes the government's\n\nclaim that the search was a valid search incident to arrest,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fbecause the police searched the apartment after he had been placed\n\nin handcuffs and removed from the room.\n\n              The government leads with its best punch.   We therefore\n\nconsider first whether the evidence was obtained pursuant to a\n\nvalid probation search.\n\n              Certain relevant principles are well established.   To be\n\nvalid under the Fourth Amendment, a search must be \"reasonable.\"\n\nKnights, 534 U.S. at 119 (\"The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment\n\nis reasonableness\").       Typically, to be considered reasonable a\n\nsearch of a home must be supported by probable cause and be\n\nexecuted pursuant to a particularized warrant authorizing the\n\nsearch.   See Weikert, 504 F.3d at 6; United States v. Curzi, 867\n\nF.2d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"warrantless searches of a dwelling-\n\nplace   are    presumptively   unreasonable\").    However,   there   are\n\nexceptions to the probable cause and warrant requirements, as the\n\nreasonableness of any search is ultimately determined by examining\n\nthe \"totality of the circumstances\" and balancing on one hand \"the\n\ndegree to which [the search] intrudes upon an individual's privacy\"\n\nand on the other \"the degree to which [the search] is needed for\n\nthe promotion of legitimate government interests.\"        Knights, 534\n\nU.S. at 118-19.\n\n              Where a defendant on probation is challenging a probation\n\nsearch, that fact significantly influences the required balancing.\n\nAs a conditional releasee, a probationer has a substantially\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fdiminished expectation of privacy.         Id. at 119 (\"Inherent in the\n\nvery nature of probation is that probationers do not enjoy the\n\nabsolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled\"); see also\n\nSamson, 547 U.S. at 848 (noting that Knights court concluded that\n\nprobationers have a reduced liberty interest \"by virtue of their\n\nstatus alone\"); Weikert, 504 F.3d at 11.              This expectation of\n\nprivacy can be further shaped by search conditions in the probation\n\norder where the order \"clearly express[es]\" the conditions and the\n\nprobationer is \"unambiguously informed\" of them. Knights, 534 U.S.\n\nat 119-20; see also Weikert, 504 F.3d at 8 (examining Knights).\n\nFor example, in Knights, the Supreme Court noted that a probation\n\ncondition that notified the defendant that he could be searched\n\nwithout   a    search     warrant    \"significantly        diminished    [his]\n\nexpectation of privacy.\" Knights, 534 U.S. at 119-20; Weikert, 504\n\nF.3d at 8 (noting that the defendant in Knights had an inherently\n\nreduced expectation of privacy, which the search condition served\n\nto further reduce).\n\n          In considering the other side of the balance, that the\n\ngovernment has a legitimate interest in searching probationers is\n\nbeyond question.      \"'[T]he very assumption of the institution of\n\nprobation'    is   that   the   probationer   'is   more    likely   than   the\n\nordinary citizen to violate the law.'\"          Knights, 534 U.S. at 120\n\n(quoting Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 880 (1987)).               As the\n\nSupreme Court has observed, probationers have \"more of an incentive\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fto    conceal   their   criminal   activities   and   quickly   dispose    of\n\nincriminating evidence than the ordinary criminal because [they\n\nare] aware that they may be subject to supervision and face\n\nrevocation of probation, and possible incarceration, in proceedings\n\nin which the trial rights of a jury and proof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, among other things, do not apply.\"         Id. at 120.\n\n             Neither party disputes that these principles control the\n\nconstitutional analysis.       They do, however, spar over how this\n\nanalysis is influenced by one unique aspect of this case.                 The\n\nsearch here occurred in the state of Massachusetts.             The Supreme\n\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts, in Lafrance, concluded that while\n\nthe     Massachusetts   constitution   permits    probationary     searches\n\nfounded on \"reasonable suspicion,\" police executing such searches\n\nmust first obtain a search warrant, absent the availability of a\n\ntraditional exception to the warrant requirement.           525 N.E.2d at\n\n382.5     In its opinion, the court proposed that a condition be\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The Supreme Judicial Court offered the following reasoning for\nits ruling.\n\n        [Requiring officers to possess] a search warrant [issued]\n        on a proper showing of reasonable cause 'is not an undue\n        burden on the probation officer and provides the\n        protection for the probationer guaranteed by the\n        constitutions [State and Federal] . . . Upholding the\n        warrant requirements for searches of the probationer's\n        home does not impede the dual goals of probation,\n        protecting the public and rehabilitation.\n\n525 N.E.2d at 382-83.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fincluded in future probation orders to reflect its holding.               The\n\ncourt structured this condition as follows:\n\n          On the basis of a reasonable suspicion that a\n          condition of the probationer's probation has\n          been violated, a probation officer, or any law\n          enforcement officer acting on the request of\n          the   probation   office,   may   search   the\n          probationer, her property, her residence, and\n          any place where she may be living, and may do\n          so with or without a search warrant depending\n          on the requirements of law.\n\n\nId. at 383 (citation omitted).         As it turns out, this is the\n\nprecise condition to which Graham was subject.6\n\n          Graham and the government draw different conclusions\n\nabout the import of LaFrance and the probation condition.             Graham,\n\nas he must, concedes that it does not follow that because a search\n\nviolates the Massachusetts constitution it necessarily violates the\n\nFourth   Amendment.        Nevertheless,   he        argues    that   because\n\nMassachusetts law typically requires a search warrant, and because\n\nthe search condition in his probation order informed him of this\n\nrequirement, his expectation of privacy was sufficiently heightened\n\nthat the Fourth Amendment balance must be struck in his favor.            The\n\ngovernment,   in   turn,   relies    heavily    on    the     uncontroversial\n\n\n\n6\n We note that the search condition did inform Graham that he could\nbe searched \"with or without a search warrant depending on the\nrequirements of law.\" Our resolution of this case does not require\nus to construe this language as anything other than reflecting the\nMassachusetts court's conclusion that warrantless searches could be\njustified if a traditional exception to the warrant requirement\napplied.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fprinciple that \"federal law governs the admissibility of evidence\n\nin   federal   prosecutions,\"   noting    that   the   Supreme    Court   has\n\nconcluded that violations of state laws are not per se violations\n\nof the constitution.    See Virginia v. Moore, 128 S. Ct. 1598, 1608\n\n(2008) (\"it is not the province of the Fourth Amendment to enforce\n\nstate law\").    The government also cites a number of decisions from\n\nother circuits that have, in the absence of an applicable law or\n\nsearch condition, upheld warrantless searches based on a reduced\n\nlevel of suspicion.     See, e.g., United States v. Yuknavich, 419\n\nF.3d 1302, 1311 (11th Cir. 2005); United States v. Keith, 375 F.3d\n\n346, 350-51 (5th Cir. 2004).\n\n           Neither argument perfectly resolves the issue.              Graham\n\nappears to argue that because conditions of probation shape a\n\ndefendant's expectation of privacy, searches in violation of those\n\nconditions must violate the Fourth Amendment.          This is a somewhat\n\nmore muted version of the easily dismissed argument that state law\n\ncontrols in federal court.      Turning to the government's arguments,\n\nthe government's first salvo, that the Fourth Amendment and not the\n\nMassachusetts constitution, controls the analysis, though accurate,\n\nsomewhat   obscures    the   controlling    principles.          The   Fourth\n\nAmendment's totality of the circumstances test does account for a\n\nprobationer's expectation of privacy, which in turn may be shaped\n\nto some degree by state law and by what the state has communicated\n\nto the probationer.    The Supreme Court appears to have established\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fas much in cases like Knights and Samson.                    Knights, 534 U.S. at\n\n119-20; Samson, 547 U.S. at 852. And although the government cites\n\nto   a   number      of   cases   where    courts     have   upheld   searches   of\n\nprobationers based on a reduced level of suspicion in the absence\n\nof a relevant law and search condition, we find those cases to be\n\nof little help in considering this case where there exists both on\n\npoint state law and a search condition consistent with that law.\n\n               Ultimately, that Graham was notified that Massachusetts\n\nstate    law    requires     police   to    possess     a    search   warrant   when\n\nconducting       a    probation    search        is   neither    dispositive     nor\n\ninconsequential in the constitutional analysis.                 Rather, it is one\n\nfactor in considering the totality of the circumstances.                        This\n\nconclusion is unremarkable. See United States v. Chirino, 483 F.3d\n\n141, 149 (2d Cir. 2007) (\"While state-law rules and practices may\n\ninform our evaluation of the totality of the circumstances, 'the\n\nappropriate inquiry for a federal court considering a motion to\n\nsuppress evidence by state police officers is whether the arrest,\n\nsearch, or seizure violated the Fourth Amendment . . . because the\n\nexclusionary rule is only concerned with deterring Constitutional\n\nviolations.\") (citing United States v. Wright, 16 F.3d 1429, 1437\n\n(6th Cir. 1994)); see also United States v. Gonzales, 535 F.3d\n\n1174, 1182 (10th Cir. 2008) (\"Although [] we have indicated that\n\ncompliance with state law may be relevant to our Fourth Amendment\n\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\freasonableness analysis, we have never held it to be determinative\n\nof the constitutionality of police conduct.\") (citation omitted).\n\n          With the state pronouncements given their proper place in\n\nthe analysis, the balancing of the relevant interests leads us to\n\nconclude that the search in this case was reasonable.   As we have\n\nnoted, the government has a significant interest in monitoring\n\nprobationers, given their proclivity to both commit and cover up\n\ncrimes. And Graham's expectation of privacy was greatly diminished\n\nby both his status as a probationer and the probation condition in\n\nhis probation order that expressly informed him that the government\n\ncould force him to submit to random drug testing and could search\n\nhim, his property, his residence or a place he may be living based\n\non reasonable suspicion rather than the more protective probable\n\ncause standard.   Although Graham's probation order did further\n\ninform him that police would go through the formal process of\n\nobtaining a search warrant before executing a search, that the\n\nofficers failed to do so does not merit suppression considering the\n\nimportant governmental interests at stake and Graham's inherently\n\ndiminished expectation of privacy.\n\n          Put plainly, we cannot say that where, as here, the\n\npolice possess reasonable suspicion that a probationer is violating\n\nthe terms of probation, the Fourth Amendment demands that the\n\npolice secure a search warrant before executing a probation search.\n\nSee Moore, 128 S.Ct. at 1606 (\"A state is free to prefer one\n\n\n                               -23-\n\fsearch-and-seizure    police   among   the   range   of   constitutionally\n\npermissible options, but its choice of a more restrictive option\n\ndoes not render the less restrictive ones unreasonable, and hence\n\nunconstitutional.\"); see also Lovelock, 170 F.3d at 343-44 (\"What\n\na citizen is assured by the Fourth Amendment . . . is not that no\n\ngovernment search . . . will occur in the absence of a warrant or\n\nan applicable exception to the warrant requirement, but that no\n\nsuch search will occur that is 'unreasonable'\") (citing Illinois v.\n\nRodriguez, 497 U.S. 177, 183 (1990) (some internal quotations\n\nomitted))); Chirino, 483 F.3d at 149-50 (holding that probation\n\nsearch did not violate Fourth Amendment even though the search was\n\nconducted without prior court authorization as required under state\n\nlaw).7   Because we conclude that the evidence was obtained pursuant\n\na valid probation search, we need not reach the government's search\n\nincident to arrest argument.\n\n                          III.    Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons provided above, the district court's\n\nruling is affirmed.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n7\n  The district court suggested that the police could have conducted\na valid probation search even absent any suspicion that Graham had\nviolated the terms of his probation order. It noted, however, that\nthere was ample evidence in the record to support a finding that\nthe police had reasonable suspicion that Graham had done so. As\nthat conclusion has not been challenged, we need not examine\nwhether a suspicionless search would offend the Fourth Amendment.\n\n                                  -24-\n\f",

Vogelbaum, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Randall E. Kromm, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before HOWARD, BALDOCK<sup>[*]</sup>, and SELYA, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Appellant Derek Graham was on probation in Massachusetts for various drug offenses. When he failed to comply with probation reporting requirements, the police secured a warrant for his arrest. To execute this warrant, officers entered an apartment, and, after finding Graham in one of the apartment's bedrooms, they arrested him and searched the room. The search yielded a sawed-off shotgun and ammunition. Based on this evidence, a federal grand jury charged Graham with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p>Graham sought to suppress the evidence, arguing that the police violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution in acquiring it. After the district court resolved the suppression motion against Graham, he entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the suppression ruling. He now exercises that right.</p>\n<p>Graham argues that both the officers' entry into the apartment and the subsequent search of the bedroom where he was arrested violated the Fourth Amendment. He claims that because he was a social guest in the apartment, the police needed to first obtain a search warrant to enter the apartment, in addition to the arrest warrant they had procured. Additionally, he argues that even if the arrest warrant justified the entry into the apartment, the police still needed a search warrant to conduct the search of the bedroom.</p>\n<p>In response, the government argues that the entry by the officers was permitted under the rule of <i>Payton v. New York,</i> 445 U.S. 573, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980), because they had a warrant for Graham's arrest, and they reasonably believed prior to entry that Graham resided at the apartment. As for the subsequent search of the bedroom, the government submits that the search was justified as either a valid probation search or a search incident to arrest. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We state the relevant facts as the trial court found them, consistent with record support. <i>United States v. Ruidiaz,</i> 529 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>After committing various drug offenses, Derek Graham was sentenced to probation by a Massachusetts state court. The probation order, issued in mid-October 2004, required Graham to comply with several standard conditions. The order also included the following search condition:</p>\n<blockquote>On the basis of a reasonable suspicion that a condition of the probationer's probation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> has been violated, a probation officer, or any law enforcement officer acting on the request of the probation office, may search the probationer's property, his or her residence, and any place where he or she may be living, and may do so with or without a search warrant, depending on the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<p>Graham signed the probation order, indicating that he had read and understood the conditions of probation.</p>\n<p>Although on probation for drug offenses, Graham had previously pled guilty to possessing firearms illegally, and the police connected him with a violent gang in his neighborhood known as the Crown Path Gang. This gang had an ongoing rivalry with a gang from a neighboring area known as the Everton Young Guns.</p>\n<p>Graham fell out of compliance with the probation order in late-October 2004, failing to meet the order's reporting requirements. As a result, Graham's probation officer, Thomas Todd (Todd), sought and obtained a warrant for his arrest. Todd understood Graham to be living with his mother in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The police attempted to execute the warrant at this location but did not find him there.</p>\n<p>Over the next few months, Todd learned that Graham had potentially violated another one of the conditions of his probation, this one requiring him to obey all local, state, and federal laws. Specifically, another probationer told Todd that Graham had \"brandished a weapon on him\" and a member of the Everton Young Guns told Todd that the gang suspected Graham was responsible for several shootings of their members.</p>\n<p>At first unable to locate Graham, in time the authorities began to hone in on his whereabouts. In May 2005, Todd learned from another probation officer that Graham had been \"staying at\" a house on the corner of Harvard Street and Harvard Park. The address of this building was 18 Harvard Street. After receiving the tip, Todd drove by the house. He recalled having previously seen another member of the Crown Path Gang on the house's porch. Todd provided the Boston Police Department with this information. The police then informed Todd of a report of a domestic incident at 18 Harvard Street, identifying Graham as the offender. The report stated that Chanice Meadows (Chanice) alleged that she had been threatened by her daughter's boyfriend, Derek Graham. The report listed Graham's address as 18 Harvard Street.</p>\n<p>Based on this information, a magistrate added the 18 Harvard Street address to the arrest warrant for Graham. Todd again contacted the Boston Police Department and requested that the warrant be executed. Todd informed the police that Graham might be armed, that Graham was subject to a probation search condition, and that a probation officer would be available to perform the probation search if Graham were found. The police informed Todd that the warrant would be executed the next day, a Saturday.</p>\n<p>Around 7 a.m. on Saturday morning, police officers went to 18 Harvard Street with the arrest warrant. They showed a picture of Graham to the person who answered the door and were directed to the third-floor apartment. Chanice answered the door to the apartment but denied that Graham was present. The officers informed Chanice that they had a warrant and entered the apartment to look for Graham.</p>\n<p>They discovered Graham in the apartment's rear bedroom. The officers noticed a number of items in the room, including men's clothes on the floor and in a duffel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> bag, several boxes of shoes against a wall, men's toiletries on a bureau next to a bed, and a newspaper clipping and several pictures on a wall in the room. The newspaper clipping concerned the murder of a member of the Everton Young Guns  the Crown Path Gang's rival gang  and the pictures were of individuals making hand-signs associated with the Crown Path Gang.</p>\n<p>The officers arrested Graham, handcuffed him, and brought him to the living room, which was in the front of the apartment. They then contacted the probation officer on duty, who arrived at the apartment fifteen minutes later with copies of Graham's probation documents. The probation officer asked the officers to search the bedroom where Graham was found. In the course of this search, the police found a sawed off shotgun and ammunition in the drawer of a dresser. The officers also discovered a small safe underneath the bed. Using a knife, an officer opened the safe and discovered various types of ammunition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>State court proceeding</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Massachusetts charged Graham with possession of a shotgun and ammunition in violation of state law. Graham moved to suppress the evidence. After a suppression hearing, the state court granted Graham's motion.</p>\n<p>The state court concluded that the officers' entry into the apartment was justified under <i>Payton</i> because the officers reasonably believed that Graham resided at the apartment. The court, however, determined that the subsequent search of the room where Graham was found violated Graham's rights under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in the Massachusetts constitution. The court explained that article 14 of the Massachusetts constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <i>Commonwealth v. LaFrance,</i> 402 Mass. 789, 525 N.E.2d 379 (1988), barred probation searches executed without a search warrant unless \"one of the established exceptions to [the search warrant] requirement\" applied. Finding that no such exception applied in Graham's case, the state court suppressed the evidence.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Federal district court proceeding</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Subsequent to the state court's resolution of the suppression issue, the United States charged Graham in federal court with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.</p>\n<p>Like the state court, the federal court concluded that the police entry into the apartment was permissible under <i>Payton.</i> The court ruled in the alternative that the probation order itself allowed the officers to enter the apartment. Unlike the state court, however, the district court concluded that the police did not need a search warrant to search the room where Graham was found.</p>\n<p>The district court determined that the police collected the evidence from the bedroom pursuant to a valid probation search. Relying on <i>United States v. Knights,</i> 534 U.S. 112, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001) and <i>Samson v. California,</i> 547 U.S. 843, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 165 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006), two cases analyzing warrantless searches of defendants on conditional release,<sup>[2]</sup> the court concluded that as a probationer, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> Graham had such a reduced expectation of privacy that a warrantless search was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The court rejected Graham's argument that the search violated the Fourth Amendment because the police, in defiance of state law, failed to obtain a search warrant. The court determined instead that the admissibility of evidence in a federal proceeding is governed solely by federal law, and federal law did not require a search warrant.</p>\n<p>The court also stated that an alternative basis for upholding the search, <i>viz.,</i> that it was a valid search incident to arrest. Although Graham had been handcuffed and removed from the room prior to the search, the court determined that the areas searched and items seized were within his reach at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>When reviewing the disposition of a suppression ruling, we review the district court's factual findings for clear error and its ultimate constitutional conclusion de novo. <i>United States v. Nascimento,</i> 491 F.3d 25, 50 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The entry into the apartment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Graham first challenges the initial entry into his apartment, understanding that if we find this entry unjustified the evidence discovered subsequent to it must be suppressed. Graham contends that because he did not \"reside\" at the apartment, because he was merely an overnight guest, the police needed a search warrant in order to enter the apartment, in addition to the arrest warrant that they procured. He also argues that the entry into the apartment was not permissible under <i>Payton,</i> because the officers did not \"reasonably believe\" that he resided in the apartment. The government disagrees, contending that the arrest warrant itself, coupled with evidence supporting a reasonable belief that Graham resided in the apartment, was sufficient under <i>Payton</i> to permit entry into the apartment.</p>\n<p><i>Payton</i> is the lodestar. In that case, the Supreme Court held that police armed with an arrest warrant for a suspect founded on probable cause may enter the dwelling of that suspect when \"there is reason to believe [he] is within.\" 445 U.S. at 602, 100 S.Ct. 1371. Subsequent to <i>Payton,</i> courts have held that even where it is discovered after entry that the dwelling <i>is not</i> the suspect's, the initial entry may be justified under <i>Payton</i> provided the police reasonably believed, prior to entry, that the suspect <i>did</i> reside at the dwelling. <i>United States v. Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d 339, 343-44 (2d Cir. 1999) (observing that although <i>Payton</i> requires that the entering officers reasonably believe that the subject of the arrest warrant resides at the place entered, that belief need not ultimately be correct); <i>United States v. Risse,</i> 83 F.3d 212, 216 (8th Cir.1996) (\"The officers' assessment need not in fact be correct; rather, they need only `reasonably believe' that the suspect resides at the dwelling to be searched and is currently present at the dwelling.\") (citations omitted); <i>United States v. Route,</i> 104 F.3d 59, 63 (5th Cir. 1997) (same).</p>\n<p>Whether Graham actually \"resided\" at the apartment, then, is not dispositive so long as the police \"reasonably believed\" prior to entry that he (1) resided at the apartment and (2) would be present. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Weems,</i> 322 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.2003) (citing <i>United States v. Gay,</i> 240 F.3d 1222, 1226-27 (10th Cir. 2001), for the proposition that \"<i>Payton</i> allows entry because officers had a reasonable belief that subject of arrest warrant lived at the house they entered\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 429 F.3d 282, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> 286 (D.C.Cir.2005). At issue in this case is whether the police had a \"reasonable belief of residence,\" and not the second requirement, whether they had \"reason to believe\" Graham was within the apartment when they entered.</p>\n<p>In determining whether the officers possessed a reasonable belief that Graham resided at the apartment, we examine the basis for that belief. <i>United States v. Bervaldi,</i> 226 F.3d 1256, 1263 (11th Cir.2000) (examining \"the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of law enforcement agents . . . viewed in the totality\") (citation omitted); <i>Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d at 343. Of course, certain facts will almost always give rise to a reasonable belief that the subject of an arrest warrant resides at the place entered. For example, in <i>United States v. Route</i> police concluded that the subject of the arrest warrant resided at the house entered because his credit card applications, utility bill, car registration, and mail were directed to the house. 104 F.3d 59, 62 nn. 1 &amp; 63 (5th Cir.1997). However, the police need not possess such rock-solid indicators of residence in order to form a \"reasonable belief\" that a suspect resides at a given place.</p>\n<p>Two cases from the Eighth Circuit, <i>United States v. Clayton,</i> 210 F.3d 841 (8th Cir.2000) and <i>United States v. Risse,</i> 83 F.3d 212 (8th Cir.1996), are instructive. In <i>Clayton,</i> a police record indicated that the defendant resided in a particular house. 210 F.3d at 842-43. Officers were also told by an anonymous caller that the defendant resided at this house and were told by a person leaving the house, immediately prior to their entry, that the defendant was inside. The Eighth Circuit concluded that this information \"gave police a reasonable belief that Clayton lived at the residence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 844. In <i>Risse,</i> the subject of the arrest warrant told police that she was \"staying\" at a certain place and that officers could contact her there. 83 F.3d at 214-15. A confidential informant further told police that the subject was \"living\" at the same place with another person, and police had been unable to contact the subject at a different, permanent residence she maintained. <i>Id.</i> at 215. The court concluded that this information supported a reasonable belief of residence. <i>Id.</i> at 216-17; <i>see also </i><i>Case v. Kitsap County Sheriff's Dep't,</i> 249 F.3d 921 (9th Cir.2001) (discussing information giving rise to reasonable belief); <i>Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d at 343 (same).</p>\n<p>Similarly, we can safely conclude here that the police possessed a reasonable belief that Graham resided at the apartment. The police based their residence determination on five pieces of information. First, they possessed a police report describing a domestic incident that occurred at the apartment. The report listed Graham as the offender and, critically, listed the apartment as Graham's address. Second, another probationer told Todd, Graham's probation officer, that Graham was \"staying at\" the apartment. <i>See </i><i>Risse,</i> 83 F.3d at 216-17 (noting police could reasonably interpret colloquial phrase \"staying with\" to mean \"living with\"); <i>see also </i><i>Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d at 344. Third, immediately prior to entering the apartment, officers showed a picture of Graham to a person outside the apartment who pointed the officers towards the apartment. Fourth, Todd, on a prior occasion, saw a member of the gang Graham was associated with on the porch of the apartment. Fifth, officers had been unable to locate Graham where previously he had been living. <i>See </i><i>Risse,</i> 83 F.3d at 217 (noting that police's inability to locate subject of arrest warrant at a location previously associated with the subject could support a reasonable belief that subject <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> was residing at a different location). Taken together, this information supported a reasonable belief that Graham resided in the apartment.</p>\n<p>In challenging this conclusion, Graham criticizes individually each piece of information the officers relied on in forming their belief. But, as established above, we examine the information known to the officers in the totality and not in isolation. <i>See </i><i>Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d at 344 (rejecting defendant's argument that police did not possess reasonable belief of residence where defendant sought to \"segment, isolate, and minimize each item of evidence that contributed to the existence and reasonableness of the officers' belief\").</p>\n<p>Graham also points to a litany of facts to support his contention that he did not reside at the apartment. He notes that he did not have a key to the premises, that his clothing was on the floor and in a duffle bag and not put away in closets and dressers, that he had decorated the bedroom with only a few photos and a news clipping, and that both his shotgun and the safe where he kept his ammunition were \"readily portable items.\" This Monday-morning quarterbacking does nothing to assist our analysis. What the police discovered <i>after</i> they entered the apartment cannot help us determine what the officers could have reasonably believed <i>before</i> entering the apartment. Based on the reasoning provided above, we conclude that the officers were justified in believing Graham resided at the apartment.</p>\n<p>Graham also argues that <i>Payton</i> does not determine the outcome here, but rather two other Supreme Court cases, <i>Steagald v. United States,</i> 451 U.S. 204, 101 S.Ct. 1642, 68 L.Ed.2d 38 (1981) and <i>Minnesota v. Olson,</i> 495 U.S. 91, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990), should govern the analysis.</p>\n<p>This argument is easily dismissed. <i>Steagald</i> and <i>Olson</i> merely establish, as relevant to this case, that certain individuals have standing to object to a warrantless entry and search.<sup>[3]</sup> Those cases did not establish that those challenges would necessarily be successful where police entered a premises with <i>both</i> a warrant for an individual's arrest and a reasonable belief that the individual resided at the premises entered. In such a case, <i>Payton</i> permits entry for the limited purpose of arresting the subject of the arrest warrant. <i>See </i><i>Bervaldi,</i> 226 F.3d at 1267 n. 11 (where police \"had a reasonable belief\" that the subject of the arrest warrant resided at the place entered \"<i>Payton,</i> not <i>Steagald,</i> applies\"); <i>Pruitt,</i> 458 F.3d at 487-88 (rejecting defendant's argument that <i>Olson</i> required a search warrant where police possessed both an arrest warrant and the reasonable belief that the subject of the arrest warrant resided at the place entered).<sup>[4]</sup> Here, as established <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> above, <i>Payton</i>'s dictates permitted the police to enter the apartment for the purpose of arresting Graham.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The search of the room</i>\n</h2>\n<p>That the officers were justified in entering the apartment does not, however, resolve the issue of whether the evidence should have been suppressed. Although the officers possessed a valid arrest warrant, this warrant only permitted them to seize Graham and did not, standing alone, authorize the search of the bedroom where Graham was found. It is this search that yielded the bounty of evidence that the government introduced against Graham.</p>\n<p>The government advances two theories to justify the warrantless search. First, it argues that the search was a valid probation search. The government notes that Graham signed a probation order that allowed law enforcement to search \"any place [the probationer may be living]\" if the authorities had reasonable suspicion that Graham had violated a condition of his probation. Second, the government contends that even if the search was not a valid probation search, it was a lawful search incident to arrest.</p>\n<p>Graham asserts that neither theory of admissibility withstands scrutiny. He contends that the search, in order qualify as a valid probation search, needed to be conducted pursuant to a search warrant. This is because (1) the Massachusetts constitution requires the police, absent a \"traditional\" exception to the warrant requirement, to obtain a search warrant prior to executing a probation search and (2) the probation order informed him of the search warrant requirement. Graham also disputes the government's claim that the search was a valid search incident to arrest, because the police searched the apartment after he had been placed in handcuffs and removed from the room.</p>\n<p>The government leads with its best punch. We therefore consider first whether the evidence was obtained pursuant to a valid probation search.</p>\n<p>Certain relevant principles are well established. To be valid under the Fourth Amendment, a search must be \"reasonable.\" <i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 119, 122 S.Ct. 587 (\"The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness\"). Typically, to be considered reasonable a search of a home must be supported by probable cause and be executed pursuant to a particularized warrant authorizing the search. <i>See Weikert,</i> 504 F.3d at 6; <i>United States v. Curzi,</i> 867 F.2d 36, 41 (1st Cir.1989) (\"warrantless searches of a dwelling-place are presumptively unreasonable\"). However, there are exceptions to the probable cause and warrant requirements, as the reasonableness of any search is ultimately determined by examining the \"totality of the circumstances\" and balancing on one hand \"the degree to which [the search] intrudes upon an individual's privacy\" and on the other \"the degree to which [the search] is needed for the promotion of legitimate government interests.\" <i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 118-19, 122 S.Ct. 587.</p>\n<p>Where a defendant on probation is challenging a probation search, that fact significantly influences the required balancing. As a conditional releasee, a probationer has a substantially diminished expectation of privacy. <i>Id.</i> at 119, 122 S.Ct. 587 (\"Inherent in the very nature of probation is that probationers do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled\"); <i>see also </i><i>Samson,</i> 547 U.S. at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> 848, 126 S.Ct. 2193 (noting that <i>Knights</i> court concluded that probationers have a reduced liberty interest \"by virtue of their status alone\"); <i>Weikert,</i> 504 F.3d at 11. This expectation of privacy can be further shaped by search conditions in the probation order where the order \"clearly express[es]\" the conditions and the probationer is \"unambiguously informed\" of them. <i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 119-20, 122 S.Ct. 587; <i>see also </i><i>Weikert,</i> 504 F.3d at 8 (examining <i>Knights</i>). For example, in <i>Knights,</i> the Supreme Court noted that a probation condition that notified the defendant that he could be searched without a search warrant \"significantly diminished [his] expectation of privacy.\" <i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 119-20, 122 S.Ct. 587; <i>Weikert,</i> 504 F.3d at 8 (noting that the defendant in <i>Knights</i> had an inherently reduced expectation of privacy, which the search condition served to further reduce).</p>\n<p>In considering the other side of the balance, that the government has a legitimate interest in searching probationers is beyond question. \"`[T]he very assumption of the institution of probation' is that the probationer `is more likely than the ordinary citizen to violate the law.'\" <i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 120, 122 S.Ct. 587 (quoting <i>Griffin v. Wisconsin,</i> 483 U.S. 868, 880, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987)). As the Supreme Court has observed, probationers have \"more of an incentive to conceal their criminal activities and quickly dispose of incriminating evidence than the ordinary criminal because [they are] aware that they may be subject to supervision and face revocation of probation, and possible incarceration, in proceedings in which the trial rights of a jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, among other things, do not apply.\" <i>Id.</i> at 120, 122 S.Ct. 587.</p>\n<p>Neither party disputes that these principles control the constitutional analysis. They do, however, spar over how this analysis is influenced by one unique aspect of this case. The search here occurred in the state of Massachusetts. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in <i>LaFrance,</i> concluded that while the Massachusetts constitution permits probationary searches founded on \"reasonable suspicion,\" police executing such searches must first obtain a search warrant, absent the availability of a traditional exception to the warrant requirement. 525 N.E.2d at 382.<sup>[5]</sup> In its opinion, the court proposed that a condition be included in future probation orders to reflect its holding. The court structured this condition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>On the basis of a reasonable suspicion that a condition of the probationer's probation has been violated, a probation officer, or any law enforcement officer acting on the request of the probation office, may search the probationer, her property, her residence, and any place where she may be living, and may do so with or without a search warrant depending on the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 383 (citation omitted). As it turns out, this is the precise condition to which Graham was subject.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> Graham and the government draw different conclusions about the import of <i>LaFrance</i> and the probation condition. Graham, as he must, concedes that it does not follow that because a search violates the Massachusetts constitution it necessarily violates the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless, he argues that because Massachusetts law typically requires a search warrant, and because the search condition in his probation order informed him of this requirement, his expectation of privacy was sufficiently heightened that the Fourth Amendment balance must be struck in his favor. The government, in turn, relies heavily on the uncontroversial principle that \"federal law governs the admissibility of evidence in federal prosecutions,\" noting that the Supreme Court has concluded that violations of state laws are not per se violations of the constitution. <i>See </i><i>Virginia v. Moore,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 1608, 170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008) (\"it is not the province of the Fourth Amendment to enforce state law\"). The government also cites a number of decisions from other circuits that have, in the absence of an applicable law or search condition, upheld warrantless searches based on a reduced level of suspicion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Yuknavich,</i> 419 F.3d 1302, 1311 (11th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Keith,</i> 375 F.3d 346, 350-51 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p>Neither argument perfectly resolves the issue. Graham appears to argue that because conditions of probation shape a defendant's expectation of privacy, searches in violation of those conditions must violate the Fourth Amendment. This is a somewhat more muted version of the easily dismissed argument that state law controls in federal court. Turning to the government's arguments, the government's first salvo, that the Fourth Amendment and not the Massachusetts constitution, controls the analysis, though accurate, somewhat obscures the controlling principles. The Fourth Amendment's totality of the circumstances test does account for a probationer's expectation of privacy, which in turn may be shaped to some degree by state law and by what the state has communicated to the probationer. The Supreme Court appears to have established as much in cases like <i>Knights</i> and <i>Samson. </i><i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 119-20, 122 S.Ct. 587; <i>Samson,</i> 547 U.S. at 852, 126 S.Ct. 2193. And although the government cites to a number of cases where courts have upheld searches of probationers based on a reduced level of suspicion in the absence of a relevant law and search condition, we find those cases to be of little help in considering this case where there exists both on point state law and a search condition consistent with that law.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, that Graham was notified that Massachusetts state law requires police to possess a search warrant when conducting a probation search is neither dispositive nor inconsequential in the constitutional analysis. Rather, it is one factor in considering the totality of the circumstances. This conclusion is unremarkable. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Chirino,</i> 483 F.3d 141, 149 (2d Cir.2007) (\"While state-law rules and practices may inform our evaluation of the totality of the circumstances, `the appropriate inquiry for a federal court considering a motion to suppress evidence by state police officers is whether the arrest, search, or seizure violated the Fourth Amendment . . . because the exclusionary rule is only concerned with deterring Constitutional violations.'\") <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> (citing <i>United States v. Wright,</i> 16 F.3d 1429, 1437 (6th Cir. 1994)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Gonzales,</i> 535 F.3d 1174, 1182 (10th Cir.2008) (\"Although [ ] we have indicated that compliance with state law may be relevant to our Fourth Amendment reasonableness analysis, we have never held it to be determinative of the constitutionality of police conduct.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>With the state pronouncements given their proper place in the analysis, the balancing of the relevant interests leads us to conclude that the search in this case was reasonable. As we have noted, the government has a significant interest in monitoring probationers, given their proclivity to both commit and cover up crimes. And Graham's expectation of privacy was greatly diminished by both his status as a probationer and the probation condition in his probation order that expressly informed him that the government could force him to submit to random drug testing and could search him, his property, his residence or a place he may be living based on reasonable suspicion rather than the more protective probable cause standard. Although Graham's probation order did further inform him that police would go through the formal process of obtaining a search warrant before executing a search, that the officers failed to do so does not merit suppression considering the important governmental interests at stake and Graham's inherently diminished expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p>Put plainly, we cannot say that where, as here, the police possess reasonable suspicion that a probationer is violating the terms of probation, the Fourth Amendment demands that the police secure a search warrant before executing a probation search. <i>See </i><i>Moore,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1606 (\"A state is free to prefer one search-and-seizure police among the range of constitutionally permissible options, but its choice of a more restrictive option does not render the less restrictive ones unreasonable, and hence unconstitutional.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d at 343-44 (\"What a citizen is assured by the Fourth Amendment . . . is not that no government search . . . will occur in the absence of a warrant or an applicable exception to the warrant requirement, but that no such search will occur that is `unreasonable'\") (citing <i>Illinois v. Rodriguez,</i> 497 U.S. 177, 183, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990) (some internal quotations omitted)); <i>Chirino,</i> 483 F.3d at 149-50 (holding that probation search did not violate Fourth Amendment even though the search was conducted without prior court authorization as required under state law).<sup>[7]</sup> Because we conclude that the evidence was obtained pursuant a valid probation search, we need not reach the government's search incident to arrest argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons provided above, the district court's ruling is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Although a search incident to arrest is an established exception to the warrant requirement, state prosecutors did not argue that the evidence was seized as a result of a search incident to arrest.</p>\n<p>[2]  Probation, parole and supervised release are forms of conditional release. <i>United States v. Weikert,</i> 504 F.3d 1, 7 n. 4 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[3]  In <i>Steagald,</i> the police, armed with an arrest warrant for a man named Ricky Lyons, entered a home \"based on their belief that [] Lyons might be a guest there.\" 451 U.S. at 213, 101 S.Ct. 1642. On these facts, the Supreme Court concluded that the defendant, Gary Steagald, a resident of the house who was not named in the arrest warrant, could challenge the police's failure to obtain a search warrant prior to entering the residence to search for Lyons. <i>See id.</i> at 223, 101 S.Ct. 1642. In <i>Olson,</i> the police entered a home for the purpose of arresting Olson, the defendant. 495 U.S. at 94, 110 S.Ct. 1684. The police possessed neither an arrest warrant nor a search warrant and did not claim to possess a reasonable belief that Olson resided at the home. <i>See id.</i> The Supreme Court determined that Olson, an overnight guest, had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his host's home and thus could challenge the warrantless entry under the Fourth Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 100, 110 S.Ct. 1684.</p>\n<p>[4]  In addition to arguing that <i>Payton</i> permits officers to enter a place for the purpose of arresting the subject of an arrest warrant, the government contends that Graham (a non-resident) cannot even raise a <i>Steagald</i> claim. Both the Supreme Court and this court have left this question open, <i>see </i><i>Steagald,</i> 451 U.S. at 219, 101 S.Ct. 1642; <i>Weems,</i> 322 F.3d at 23 n. 3, and we have no need to resolve it today.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Supreme Judicial Court offered the following reasoning for its ruling.\n</p>\n<p>[Requiring officers to possess] a search warrant [issued] on a proper showing of reasonable cause `is not an undue burden on the probation officer and provides the protection for the probationer guaranteed by the constitutions [State and Federal] . . . Upholding the warrant requirements for searches of the probationer's home does not impede the dual goals of probation, protecting the public and rehabilitation.'</p>\n<p>525 N.E.2d at 382-83.</p>\n<p>[6]  We note that the search condition did inform Graham that he could be searched \"with or without a search warrant depending on the requirements of law.\" Our resolution of this case does not require us to construe this language as anything other than reflecting the Massachusetts court's conclusion that warrantless searches could be justified if a traditional exception to the warrant requirement applied.</p>\n<p>[7]  The district court suggested that the police could have conducted a valid probation search even absent any suspicion that Graham had violated the terms of his probation order. It noted, however, that there was ample evidence in the record to support a finding that the police had reasonable suspicion that Graham had done so. As that conclusion has not been challenged, we need not examine whether a suspicionless search would offend the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n\n</div>",

When he failed to comply with probation reporting requirements, the police secured a warrant for his arrest. To execute this warrant, officers entered an apartment, and, after finding Graham in one of the apartment's bedrooms, they arrested him and searched the room. The search yielded a sawed-off shotgun and ammunition. Based on this evidence, a federal grand jury charged Graham with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p>Graham sought to suppress the evidence, arguing that the police violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution in acquiring it. After the district court resolved the suppression motion against Graham, he entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the suppression ruling. He now exercises that right.</p>\n<p>Graham argues that both the officers' entry into the apartment and the subsequent search of the bedroom where he was arrested violated the Fourth Amendment. He claims that because he was a social guest in the apartment, the police needed to first obtain a search warrant to enter the apartment, in addition to the arrest warrant they had procured. Additionally, he argues that even if the arrest warrant justified the entry into the apartment, the police still needed a search warrant to conduct the search of the bedroom.</p>\n<p>In response, the government argues that the entry by the officers was permitted under the rule of <i>Payton v.

As for the subsequent search of the bedroom, the government submits that the search was justified as either a valid probation search or a search incident to arrest. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We state the relevant facts as the trial court found them, consistent with record support. <i>United States v. Ruidiaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203330\"><a href=\"/opinion/203330/united-states-v-ruidiaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>After committing various drug offenses, Derek Graham was sentenced to probation by a Massachusetts state court. The probation order, issued in mid-October 2004, required Graham to comply with several standard conditions. The order also included the following search condition:</p>\n<blockquote>On the basis of a reasonable suspicion that a condition of the probationer's probation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> has been violated, a probation officer, or any law enforcement officer acting on the request of the probation office, may search the probationer's property, his or her residence, and any place where he or she may be living, and may do so with or without a search warrant, depending on the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<p>Graham signed the probation order, indicating that he had read and understood the conditions of probation.</p>\n<p>Although on probation for drug offenses, Graham had previously pled guilty to possessing firearms illegally, and the police connected him with a violent gang in his neighborhood known as the Crown Path Gang. This gang had an ongoing rivalry with a gang from a neighboring area known as the Everton Young Guns.</p>\n<p>Graham fell out of compliance with the probation order in late-October 2004, failing to meet the order's reporting requirements. As a result, Graham's probation officer, Thomas Todd (Todd), sought and obtained a warrant for his arrest. Todd understood Graham to be living with his mother in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The police attempted to execute the warrant at this location but did not find him there.</p>\n<p>Over the next few months, Todd learned that Graham had potentially violated another one of the conditions of his probation, this one requiring him to obey all local, state, and federal laws. Specifically, another probationer told Todd that Graham had \"brandished a weapon on him\" and a member of the Everton Young Guns told Todd that the gang suspected Graham was responsible for several shootings of their members.</p>\n<p>At first unable to locate Graham, in time the authorities began to hone in on his whereabouts. In May 2005, Todd learned from another probation officer that Graham had been \"staying at\" a house on the corner of Harvard Street and Harvard Park. The address of this building was 18 Harvard Street. After receiving the tip, Todd drove by the house. He recalled having previously seen another member of the Crown Path Gang on the house's porch. Todd provided the Boston Police Department with this information. The police then informed Todd of a report of a domestic incident at 18 Harvard Street, identifying Graham as the offender. The report stated that Chanice Meadows (Chanice) alleged that she had been threatened by her daughter's boyfriend, Derek Graham. The report listed Graham's address as 18 Harvard Street.</p>\n<p>Based on this information, a magistrate added the 18 Harvard Street address to the arrest warrant for Graham. Todd again contacted the Boston Police Department and requested that the warrant be executed. Todd informed the police that Graham might be armed, that Graham was subject to a probation search condition, and that a probation officer would be available to perform the probation search if Graham were found. The police informed Todd that the warrant would be executed the next day, a Saturday.</p>\n<p>Around 7 a.m. on Saturday morning, police officers went to 18 Harvard Street with the arrest warrant. They showed a picture of Graham to the person who answered the door and were directed to the third-floor apartment. Chanice answered the door to the apartment but denied that Graham was present. The officers informed Chanice that they had a warrant and entered the apartment to look for Graham.</p>\n<p>They discovered Graham in the apartment's rear bedroom. The officers noticed a number of items in the room, including men's clothes on the floor and in a duffel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> bag, several boxes of shoes against a wall, men's toiletries on a bureau next to a bed, and a newspaper clipping and several pictures on a wall in the room. The newspaper clipping concerned the murder of a member of the Everton Young Guns  the Crown Path Gang's rival gang  and the pictures were of individuals making hand-signs associated with the Crown Path Gang.</p>\n<p>The officers arrested Graham, handcuffed him, and brought him to the living room, which was in the front of the apartment. They then contacted the probation officer on duty, who arrived at the apartment fifteen minutes later with copies of Graham's probation documents. The probation officer asked the officers to search the bedroom where Graham was found. In the course of this search, the police found a sawed off shotgun and ammunition in the drawer of a dresser. The officers also discovered a small safe underneath the bed. Using a knife, an officer opened the safe and discovered various types of ammunition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>State court proceeding</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Massachusetts charged Graham with possession of a shotgun and ammunition in violation of state law. Graham moved to suppress the evidence. After a suppression hearing, the state court granted Graham's motion.</p>\n<p>The state court concluded that the officers' entry into the apartment was justified under <i>Payton</i> because the officers reasonably believed that Graham resided at the apartment. The court, however, determined that the subsequent search of the room where Graham was found violated Graham's rights under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in the Massachusetts constitution. The court explained that article 14 of the Massachusetts constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <i>Commonwealth v. LaFrance,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2221355\"><a href=\"/opinion/2221355/commonwealth-v-lafrance/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2221355\"><a href=\"/opinion/2221355/commonwealth-v-lafrance/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span> (1988), barred probation searches executed without a search warrant unless \"one of the established exceptions to [the search warrant] requirement\" applied. Finding that no such exception applied in Graham's case, the state court suppressed the evidence.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Federal district court proceeding</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Subsequent to the state court's resolution of the suppression issue, the United States charged Graham in federal court with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.</p>\n<p>Like the state court, the federal court concluded that the police entry into the apartment was permissible under <i>Payton.</i> The court ruled in the alternative that the probation order itself allowed the officers to enter the apartment. Unlike the state court, however, the district court concluded that the police did not need a search warrant to search the room where Graham was found.</p>\n<p>The district court determined that the police collected the evidence from the bedroom pursuant to a valid probation search.

The court rejected Graham's argument that the search violated the Fourth Amendment because the police, in defiance of state law, failed to obtain a search warrant.

Although Graham had been handcuffed and removed from the room prior to the search, the court determined that the areas searched and items seized were within his reach at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>When reviewing the disposition of a suppression ruling, we review the district court's factual findings for clear error and its ultimate constitutional conclusion de novo. <i>United States v. Nascimento,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202833\"><a href=\"/opinion/202833/united-states-v-nascimento/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The entry into the apartment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Graham first challenges the initial entry into his apartment, understanding that if we find this entry unjustified the evidence discovered subsequent to it must be suppressed. Graham contends that because he did not \"reside\" at the apartment, because he was merely an overnight guest, the police needed a search warrant in order to enter the apartment, in addition to the arrest warrant that they procured. He also argues that the entry into the apartment was not permissible under <i>Payton,</i> because the officers did not \"reasonably believe\" that he resided in the apartment. The government disagrees, contending that the arrest warrant itself, coupled with evidence supporting a reasonable belief that Graham resided in the apartment, was sufficient under <i>Payton</i> to permit entry into the apartment.</p>\n<p><i>Payton</i> is the lodestar. In that case, the Supreme Court held that police armed with an arrest warrant for a suspect founded on probable cause may enter the dwelling of that suspect when \"there is reason to believe [he] is within.\" 445 U.S. at 602, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110235\"><a href=\"/opinion/110235/payton-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1371</span></a></span>. Subsequent to <i>Payton,</i> courts have held that even where it is discovered after entry that the dwelling <i>is not</i> the suspect's, the initial entry may be justified under <i>Payton</i> provided the police reasonably believed, prior to entry, that the suspect <i>did</i> reside at the dwelling. <i>United States v. Lovelock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762400\"><a href=\"/opinion/762400/united-states-v-joseph-lovelock/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>, 343-44 (2d Cir. 1999) (observing that although <i>Payton</i> requires that the entering officers reasonably believe that the subject of the arrest warrant resides at the place entered, that belief need not ultimately be correct); <i>United States v.

At issue in this case is whether the police had a \"reasonable belief of residence,\" and not the second requirement, whether they had \"reason to believe\" Graham was within the apartment when they entered.</p>\n<p>In determining whether the officers possessed a reasonable belief that Graham resided at the apartment, we examine the basis for that belief. <i>United States v. Bervaldi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770469\"><a href=\"/opinion/770469/united-states-v-jason-r-bervaldi/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1256</span></a></span>, 1263 (11th Cir.2000) (examining \"the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of law enforcement agents . . . viewed in the totality\") (citation omitted); <i>Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d at 343. Of course, certain facts will almost always give rise to a reasonable belief that the subject of an arrest warrant resides at the place entered. For example, in <i>United States v. Route</i> police concluded that the subject of the arrest warrant resided at the house entered because his credit card applications, utility bill, car registration, and mail were directed to the house. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"11180\"><a href=\"/opinion/11180/united-states-v-route/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 62 nn. 1 &amp; 63 (5th Cir.1997). However, the police need not possess such rock-solid indicators of residence in order to form a \"reasonable belief\" that a suspect resides at a given place.</p>\n<p>Two cases from the Eighth Circuit, <i>United States v. Clayton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768495\"><a href=\"/opinion/768495/united-states-v-mark-e-clayton/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2000) and <i>United States v. Risse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717614\"><a href=\"/opinion/717614/united-states-of-america-appelleecross-appellant-v-larry-risse/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1996), are instructive. In <i>Clayton,</i> a police record indicated that the defendant resided in a particular house. 210 F.3d at 842-43. Officers were also told by an anonymous caller that the defendant resided at this house and were told by a person leaving the house, immediately prior to their entry, that the defendant was inside. The Eighth Circuit concluded that this information \"gave police a reasonable belief that Clayton lived at the residence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 844. In <i>Risse,</i> the subject of the arrest warrant told police that she was \"staying\" at a certain place and that officers could contact her there. 83 F.3d at 214-15. A confidential informant further told police that the subject was \"living\" at the same place with another person, and police had been unable to contact the subject at a different, permanent residence she maintained. <i>Id.</i> at 215. The court concluded that this information supported a reasonable belief of residence. <i>Id.</i> at 216-17; <i>see also </i><i>Case v. Kitsap County Sheriff's Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773210\"><a href=\"/opinion/773210/dawn-case-v-kitsap-county-sheriffs-department-kitsap-county-kitsap-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2001) (discussing information giving rise to reasonable belief); <i>Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d at 343 (same).</p>\n<p>Similarly, we can safely conclude here that the police possessed a reasonable belief that Graham resided at the apartment. The police based their residence determination on five pieces of information. First, they possessed a police report describing a domestic incident that occurred at the apartment. The report listed Graham as the offender and, critically, listed the apartment as Graham's address. Second, another probationer told Todd, Graham's probation officer, that Graham was \"staying at\" the apartment. <i>See </i><i>Risse,</i> 83 F.3d at 216-17 (noting police could reasonably interpret colloquial phrase \"staying with\" to mean \"living with\"); <i>see also </i><i>Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d at 344. Third, immediately prior to entering the apartment, officers showed a picture of Graham to a person outside the apartment who pointed the officers towards the apartment. Fourth, Todd, on a prior occasion, saw a member of the gang Graham was associated with on the porch of the apartment. Fifth, officers had been unable to locate Graham where previously he had been living. <i>See </i><i>Risse,</i> 83 F.3d at 217 (noting that police's inability to locate subject of arrest warrant at a location previously associated with the subject could support a reasonable belief that subject <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> was residing at a different location). Taken together, this information supported a reasonable belief that Graham resided in the apartment.</p>\n<p>In challenging this conclusion, Graham criticizes individually each piece of information the officers relied on in forming their belief. But, as established above, we examine the information known to the officers in the totality and not in isolation. <i>See </i><i>Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d at 344 (rejecting defendant's argument that police did not possess reasonable belief of residence where defendant sought to \"segment, isolate, and minimize each item of evidence that contributed to the existence and reasonableness of the officers' belief\").</p>\n<p>Graham also points to a litany of facts to support his contention that he did not reside at the apartment. He notes that he did not have a key to the premises, that his clothing was on the floor and in a duffle bag and not put away in closets and dressers, that he had decorated the bedroom with only a few photos and a news clipping, and that both his shotgun and the safe where he kept his ammunition were \"readily portable items.\" This Monday-morning quarterbacking does nothing to assist our analysis. What the police discovered <i>after</i> they entered the apartment cannot help us determine what the officers could have reasonably believed <i>before</i> entering the apartment. Based on the reasoning provided above, we conclude that the officers were justified in believing Graham resided at the apartment.</p>\n<p>Graham also argues that <i>Payton</i> does not determine the outcome here, but rather two other Supreme Court cases, <i>Steagald v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110464\"><a href=\"/opinion/110464/steagald-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110464\"><a href=\"/opinion/110464/steagald-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Olson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112416\"><a href=\"/opinion/112416/minnesota-v-olson/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112416\"><a href=\"/opinion/112416/minnesota-v-olson/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span> (1990), should govern the analysis.</p>\n<p>This argument is easily dismissed. <i>Steagald</i> and <i>Olson</i> merely establish, as relevant to this case, that certain individuals have standing to object to a warrantless entry and search.<sup>[3]</sup> Those cases did not establish that those challenges would necessarily be successful where police entered a premises with <i>both</i> a warrant for an individual's arrest and a reasonable belief that the individual resided at the premises entered. In such a case, <i>Payton</i> permits entry for the limited purpose of arresting the subject of the arrest warrant. <i>See </i><i>Bervaldi,</i> 226 F.3d at 1267 n. 11 (where police \"had a reasonable belief\" that the subject of the arrest warrant resided at the place entered \"<i>Payton,</i> not <i>Steagald,</i> applies\"); <i>Pruitt,</i> 458 F.3d at 487-88 (rejecting defendant's argument that <i>Olson</i> required a search warrant where police possessed both an arrest warrant and the reasonable belief that the subject of the arrest warrant resided at the place entered).<sup>[4]</sup> Here, as established <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> above, <i>Payton</i>'s dictates permitted the police to enter the apartment for the purpose of arresting Graham.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The search of the room</i>\n</h2>\n<p>That the officers were justified in entering the apartment does not, however, resolve the issue of whether the evidence should have been suppressed. Although the officers possessed a valid arrest warrant, this warrant only permitted them to seize Graham and did not, standing alone, authorize the search of the bedroom where Graham was found. It is this search that yielded the bounty of evidence that the government introduced against Graham.</p>\n<p>The government advances two theories to justify the warrantless search. First, it argues that the search was a valid probation search. The government notes that Graham signed a probation order that allowed law enforcement to search \"any place [the probationer may be living]\" if the authorities had reasonable suspicion that Graham had violated a condition of his probation. Second, the government contends that even if the search was not a valid probation search, it was a lawful search incident to arrest.</p>\n<p>Graham asserts that neither theory of admissibility withstands scrutiny. He contends that the search, in order qualify as a valid probation search, needed to be conducted pursuant to a search warrant. This is because (1) the Massachusetts constitution requires the police, absent a \"traditional\" exception to the warrant requirement, to obtain a search warrant prior to executing a probation search and (2) the probation order informed him of the search warrant requirement. Graham also disputes the government's claim that the search was a valid search incident to arrest, because the police searched the apartment after he had been placed in handcuffs and removed from the room.</p>\n<p>The government leads with its best punch. We therefore consider first whether the evidence was obtained pursuant to a valid probation search.</p>\n<p>Certain relevant principles are well established. To be valid under the Fourth Amendment, a search must be \"reasonable.\" <i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 119, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118468\"><a href=\"/opinion/118468/united-states-v-knights/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span> (\"The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness\"). Typically, to be considered reasonable a search of a home must be supported by probable cause and be executed pursuant to a particularized warrant authorizing the search. <i>See Weikert,</i> 504 F.3d at 6; <i>United States v.

However, there are exceptions to the probable cause and warrant requirements, as the reasonableness of any search is ultimately determined by examining the \"totality of the circumstances\" and balancing on one hand \"the degree to which [the search] intrudes upon an individual's privacy\" and on the other \"the degree to which [the search] is needed for the promotion of legitimate government interests.\" <i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 118-19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118468\"><a href=\"/opinion/118468/united-states-v-knights/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the Supreme Court has observed, probationers have \"more of an incentive to conceal their criminal activities and quickly dispose of incriminating evidence than the ordinary criminal because [they are] aware that they may be subject to supervision and face revocation of probation, and possible incarceration, in proceedings in which the trial rights of a jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, among other things, do not apply.\" <i>Id.</i> at 120, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118468\"><a href=\"/opinion/118468/united-states-v-knights/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

They do, however, spar over how this analysis is influenced by one unique aspect of this case. The search here occurred in the state of Massachusetts. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in <i>LaFrance,</i> concluded that while the Massachusetts constitution permits probationary searches founded on \"reasonable suspicion,\" police executing such searches must first obtain a search warrant, absent the availability of a traditional exception to the warrant requirement. 525 N.E.2d at 382.<sup>[5]</sup> In its opinion, the court proposed that a condition be included in future probation orders to reflect its holding. The court structured this condition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>On the basis of a reasonable suspicion that a condition of the probationer's probation has been violated, a probation officer, or any law enforcement officer acting on the request of the probation office, may search the probationer, her property, her residence, and any place where she may be living, and may do so with or without a search warrant depending on the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 383 (citation omitted). As it turns out, this is the precise condition to which Graham was subject.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> Graham and the government draw different conclusions about the import of <i>LaFrance</i> and the probation condition. Graham, as he must, concedes that it does not follow that because a search violates the Massachusetts constitution it necessarily violates the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless, he argues that because Massachusetts law typically requires a search warrant, and because the search condition in his probation order informed him of this requirement, his expectation of privacy was sufficiently heightened that the Fourth Amendment balance must be struck in his favor. The government, in turn, relies heavily on the uncontroversial principle that \"federal law governs the admissibility of evidence in federal prosecutions,\" noting that the Supreme Court has concluded that violations of state laws are not per se violations of the constitution. <i>See </i><i>Virginia v. Moore,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145814\"><a href=\"/opinion/145814/virginia-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1598</span></a></span>, 1608, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145814\"><a href=\"/opinion/145814/virginia-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span> (2008) (\"it is not the province of the Fourth Amendment to enforce state law\"). The government also cites a number of decisions from other circuits that have, in the absence of an applicable law or search condition, upheld warrantless searches based on a reduced level of suspicion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Yuknavich,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1302</span></span>, 1311 (11th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Keith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"35398\"><a href=\"/opinion/35398/united-states-v-keith/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, 350-51 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p>Neither argument perfectly resolves the issue. Graham appears to argue that because conditions of probation shape a defendant's expectation of privacy, searches in violation of those conditions must violate the Fourth Amendment. This is a somewhat more muted version of the easily dismissed argument that state law controls in federal court. Turning to the government's arguments, the government's first salvo, that the Fourth Amendment and not the Massachusetts constitution, controls the analysis, though accurate, somewhat obscures the controlling principles. The Fourth Amendment's totality of the circumstances test does account for a probationer's expectation of privacy, which in turn may be shaped to some degree by state law and by what the state has communicated to the probationer. The Supreme Court appears to have established as much in cases like <i>Knights</i> and <i>Samson. </i><i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 119-20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118468\"><a href=\"/opinion/118468/united-states-v-knights/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span>; <i>Samson,</i> 547 U.S. at 852, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145640\"><a href=\"/opinion/145640/samson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2193</span></a></span>. And although the government cites to a number of cases where courts have upheld searches of probationers based on a reduced level of suspicion in the absence of a relevant law and search condition, we find those cases to be of little help in considering this case where there exists both on point state law and a search condition consistent with that law.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, that Graham was notified that Massachusetts state law requires police to possess a search warrant when conducting a probation search is neither dispositive nor inconsequential in the constitutional analysis. Rather, it is one factor in considering the totality of the circumstances. This conclusion is unremarkable. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Chirino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2738\"><a href=\"/opinion/2738/united-states-v-chirino/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 149 (2d Cir.2007) (\"While state-law rules and practices may inform our evaluation of the totality of the circumstances, `the appropriate inquiry for a federal court considering a motion to suppress evidence by state police officers is whether the arrest, search, or seizure violated the Fourth Amendment . . . because the exclusionary rule is only concerned with deterring Constitutional violations.'\") <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> (citing <i>United States v. Wright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663707\"><a href=\"/opinion/663707/united-states-v-kevin-eugene-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1429</span></a></span>, 1437 (6th Cir. 1994)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

As we have noted, the government has a significant interest in monitoring probationers, given their proclivity to both commit and cover up crimes. And Graham's expectation of privacy was greatly diminished by both his status as a probationer and the probation condition in his probation order that expressly informed him that the government could force him to submit to random drug testing and could search him, his property, his residence or a place he may be living based on reasonable suspicion rather than the more protective probable cause standard. Although Graham's probation order did further inform him that police would go through the formal process of obtaining a search warrant before executing a search, that the officers failed to do so does not merit suppression considering the important governmental interests at stake and Graham's inherently diminished expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p>Put plainly, we cannot say that where, as here, the police possess reasonable suspicion that a probationer is violating the terms of probation, the Fourth Amendment demands that the police secure a search warrant before executing a probation search. <i>See </i><i>Moore,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1606 (\"A state is free to prefer one search-and-seizure police among the range of constitutionally permissible options, but its choice of a more restrictive option does not render the less restrictive ones unreasonable, and hence unconstitutional.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Lovelock,</i> 170 F.3d at 343-44 (\"What a citizen is assured by the Fourth Amendment . . . is not that no government search . . . will occur in the absence of a warrant or an applicable exception to the warrant requirement, but that no such search will occur that is `unreasonable'\") (citing <i>Illinois v.

Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons provided above, the district court's ruling is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Although a search incident to arrest is an established exception to the warrant requirement, state prosecutors did not argue that the evidence was seized as a result of a search incident to arrest.</p>\n<p>[2]  Probation, parole and supervised release are forms of conditional release. <i>United States v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1642</span></a></span>. On these facts, the Supreme Court concluded that the defendant, Gary Steagald, a resident of the house who was not named in the arrest warrant, could challenge the police's failure to obtain a search warrant prior to entering the residence to search for Lyons. <i>See id.</i> at 223, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110464\"><a href=\"/opinion/110464/steagald-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1684</span></a></span>. The police possessed neither an arrest warrant nor a search warrant and did not claim to possess a reasonable belief that Olson resided at the home. <i>See id.</i> The Supreme Court determined that Olson, an overnight guest, had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his host's home and thus could challenge the warrantless entry under the Fourth Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 100, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112416\"><a href=\"/opinion/112416/minnesota-v-olson/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1684</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>[4]  In addition to arguing that <i>Payton</i> permits officers to enter a place for the purpose of arresting the subject of an arrest warrant, the government contends that Graham (a non-resident) cannot even raise a <i>Steagald</i> claim. Both the Supreme Court and this court have left this question open, <i>see </i><i>Steagald,</i> 451 U.S. at 219, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110464\"><a href=\"/opinion/110464/steagald-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Upholding the warrant requirements for searches of the probationer's home does not impede the dual goals of probation, protecting the public and rehabilitation.'</p>\n<p>525 N.E.2d at 382-83.</p>\n<p>[6]  We note that the search condition did inform Graham that he could be searched \"with or without a search warrant depending on the requirements of law.\" Our resolution of this case does not require us to construe this language as anything other than reflecting the Massachusetts court's conclusion that warrantless searches could be justified if a traditional exception to the warrant requirement applied.</p>\n<p>[7]  The district court suggested that the police could have conducted a valid probation search even absent any suspicion that Graham had violated the terms of his probation order. It noted, however, that there was ample evidence in the record to support a finding that the police had reasonable suspicion that Graham had done so. As that conclusion has not been challenged, we need not examine whether a suspicionless search would offend the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n\n</div>",
