He alleges that the proof was insufficient\n\nto support the jury's verdict; that the government never properly\n\nauthenticated  a \"drug ledger;\" and that the court below erred in\n\npermitting an expert witness to testify  concerning the import of\n\nthe disputed document.  Discerning no error, we affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          We  limn the facts in  the light most  favorable to the\n\ngovernment, consistent  with record  support.  See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 522 (1st Cir. 1991).\n               \n\n          Armed with a  search warrant, a team of law enforcement\n\nofficers  including FBI  Special  Agent  Frederick  Ghio  entered\n\nappellant's  apartment in  Pawtucket, Rhode  Island.   The living\n\nquarters consisted of a narrow bedroom, a multi-purpose room, and\n\na bathroom, having a total combined area roughly equal to that of\n\na  one-car garage.  When  the agents arrived,  Victor Gallego was\n\nleaving the bathroom  and appellant was seated at a  table in the\n\nmulti-purpose room.  Next to appellant, on the couch and in plain\n\nview, lay an earnings statement in his name.  On the back of this\n\nstatement  was a  handwritten column  of numbers  arrayed  in the\n\nfollowing fashion:\n\n                                2\n\n           1000\n           2000\n          17000\n           1000\n          10000\n           4000\n           1000\n               \n          34000\n\n          In  the course of the ensuing search the agents found a\n\ntape-wrapped  block  of cocaine     eighty-six  percent pure  and\n\nweighing about  two pounds    on the  toilet lid.   The tape  had\n\nbroken and the contraband  was exposed.  An electronic  scale lay\n\nnearby. \n\n          Gallego  and Echeverri were  charged with possession of\n\ncocaine with  intent to distribute  it, 21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1);\n\n841(b)(1)(B), and  with  participating  in  a  drug  distribution\n\nconspiracy.  21 U.S.C.   846.  Gallego  pled guilty and Echeverri\n\nstood trial alone.  Over his objection, the government introduced\n\nthe earnings statement  into evidence.   The court allowed  agent\n\nGhio to  testify that, in  his opinion, the  reverse side  of the\n\nstatement  comprised  a  drug  ledger  (the   individual  figures\n\ncorresponding to  per-ounce prices  for various cocaine  sales in\n\nthe Rhode Island  market).   Ghio further testified  that it  was\n\ncommon  for  cocaine  dealers  to  keep  their  accounts in  such\n\nfashion;  that the going price for cocaine was $35,000 to $40,000\n\nper  kilogram; that the total shown on the earnings statement, if\n\ninterpreted to mean \"dollars\" and  added correctly,1 corresponded\n\n                    \n\n     1The column  of figures, added  correctly, totalled  37,000,\nnot 34,000.  We consider this mathematical mishap unimportant.\n\n                                3\n\nin rough proportion  to the  gross sales price  of the  aggregate\n\ncocaine  on hand; and that  the quantity of  narcotics seized was\n\ninconsistent with personal use.\n\n          The  jury convicted  Echeverri  on both  counts.   This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\nII.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n          Appellant labors to convince us that the judgment below\n\nrests  on  too fragile  an evidentiary  foundation.   We  are not\n\npersuaded.\n\n                     A.  Standard of Review.\n                                            \n\n          The  standard of  review applicable  to sufficiency-of-\n\nthe-evidence  challenges is  settled.   An  appellate court  must\n\nexamine  the  evidence  in  the  light  most  flattering  to  the\n\nprosecution, indulging all reasonable inferences in its favor and\n\nthen determining  whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.  See, e.g., Maraj, 947 F.2d at 522-23; United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 243 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 111\n                                                            \n\nS.Ct. 139 (1990).   In making this determination, the  court must\n\ncredit both direct and  circumstantial evidence   and it  must do\n\nso without evaluating the relative  weight of different pieces of\n\nproof  or   venturing  credibility   judgments.    To   uphold  a\n\nconviction, the court need not believe that no verdict other than\n\na guilty verdict could sensibly be reached, but must only satisfy\n\nitself that  the guilty  verdict finds  support  in \"a  plausible\n\nrendition of the record.\"  United States v.  Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707,\n                                                  \n\n711 (1st Cir. 1992),  petition for cert. filed (U.S.  October 19,\n                                              \n\n                                4\n\n1992) (No. 92-6552).\n\n            B.  Possession with Intent to Distribute.\n                                                     \n\n          In challenging  his conviction on  the specific-offense\n\ncount, appellant questions whether the evidence is copious enough\n\nto  sustain a finding that  he knowingly possessed  cocaine.  The\n\ngovernment, he says, proved no more than his \"mere presence\" at a\n\nsite where drugs were found. \n\n          The  \"mere presence\" defense has become, at one and the\n\nsame time,  both the  last  haven of  the innocent  and the  last\n\nrefuge  of  the  scoundrel.    Although  courts  have  found   it\n\napplicable in  certain situations,  United States v.  Barnes, 890\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  545, 549 (1st Cir. 1989)  (collecting cases), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n494  U.S.  1019  (1990), the  mere  presence  defense  is not  so\n\nubiquitous as to envelop every drug-trafficking case in which the\n\ngovernment  lacks direct  evidence of  a defendant's  complicity.\n\nThe defendant's presence at a place where contraband is found may\n\nor may not  be purely coincidental.  The  attendant circumstances\n\ntell the tale    and  the culpability of  a defendant's  presence\n\nhinges upon whether the circumstances fairly imply  participatory\n\ninvolvement.    In other  words,  a  defendant's \"mere  presence\"\n\nargument will fail in situations where the \"mere\" is lacking.  \n\n          This is such  a situation.   There is  far more to  the\n\nprosecution's case against Echeverri  than his corporeal presence\n\nin the apartment.  A rational jury, drawing reasonable inferences\n\nfrom proven facts, could certainly have concluded that this was a\n\ncase of culpable presence as opposed to mere presence, see Ortiz,\n                                                                \n\n                                5\n\n966 F.2d at 712, and that appellant was in knowing possession  of\n\nthe contraband at the time of the raid.  We explain briefly.\n\n          Both constructive  possession and guilty  knowledge may\n\nbe  inferred from a defendant's dominion and control over an area\n\nwhere narcotics are  found.  See, e.g., Barnes, 890  F.2d at 549.\n                                              \n\nIn this  instance, there is considerable evidence of dominion and\n\ncontrol.  Appellant  concedes that the  apartment was his  abode.\n\nHis  rent receipts,  passport,  and other  personal effects  were\n\nstrewn about  the premises.  As the  lessee of the apartment, and\n\nthe one who  called it  home, appellant was  hardly powerless  to\n\ndetermine who and what could come inside.2\n\n          Moreover, the  entire apartment consisted  of a  small,\n\ncramped space.  The  cocaine was in plain view, resting openly on\n\nthe  dwelling's  only  toilet.   Tools  of  the  drug trade  were\n\nconspicuously  displayed.     Echeverri  himself  was  physically\n\npresent, seated within four feet of  the contraband.  All in all,\n\nthe  totality of  the circumstances  suffices  to support  both a\n\nfinding  of  constructive  possession  and a  finding  of  guilty\n\nknowledge.  See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez-Torres,     F.2d\n                                                       \n\n   ,      [No. 91-2140, slip op. at 2-6]; Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 713-\n                                               \n\n14;  United  States v.  Desmarais, 938  F.2d  347, 352  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1991); United  States v.  Batista-Polanco, 927  F.2d 14, 19  (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1991); Barnes, 890 F.2d at 549-51; see also United States v.\n                                                              \n\n                    \n\n     2The  fact  that  appellant,  as the  sole  rent  payer  and\nresident  of the dwelling, had the exclusive right to control the\ncomings and goings there is one of several important distinctions\nbetween this case and  United States v. Ocampo, 964  F.2d 80 (1st\n                                              \nCir. 1992), much bruited by appellant.\n\n                                6\n\nCalle-Cardenas, 837 F.2d  30, 32 (1st  Cir.) (where apartment  in\n              \n\nwhich   defendant   was   found   contained   his   clothes   and\n\nidentification   cards,   he  had   dominion  and   control  over\n\napartment), cert. denied,  485 U.S. 1024 (1988); United States v.\n                                                              \n\nLochan, 674  F.2d  960, 965-66  (1st  Cir. 1982)  (defendant  had\n      \n\ndominion  and control over area behind back seat of automobile he\n\nwas driving and,  therefore, over hashish  stowed in that  area).\n\n          The evidence  was also  ample to sustain  a finding  of\n\nscienter.  We have  repeatedly held, and today reaffirm,  that an\n\nintent  to distribute  drugs  can legitimately  be inferred  from\n\nfactors such as quantity and purity.  See, e.g., United States v.\n                                                              \n\nOcampo-Guarin, 968  F.2d 1406,  1410 (1st Cir.  1992) (collecting\n             \n\ncases); Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d at 18-19.  Such factors prevail\n                       \n\nhere.  Furthermore, agent Ghio's  testimony adds strength to  the\n\nrelevant evidentiary predicate.  \n\n          We  will not paint the  lily.  Because  we require only\n\nthat  a jury's verdict be supportable, not that it be inevitable,\n\nsee  Boylan,  898  F.2d  at   243,  we  must  affirm  appellant's\n           \n\nconviction for possession with intent to distribute.\n\n                         C.  Conspiracy.\n                                        \n\n          Appellant's  challenge  to  his  conspiracy  conviction\n\nfares  no  better.   To  support  a  conspiracy  conviction,  the\n\nprosecution  must prove  certain  things not  required under  the\n\nspecific-offense  count.    It must  show,  inter  alia,  that an\n                                                       \n\nagreement  or  working  relationship  existed,  that  it  had  an\n\nunlawful  purpose,  and  that   the  defendant  was  a  voluntary\n\n                                7\n\nparticipant in it.  See United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 735\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1991),  cert. denied,  112 S.Ct. 605,  908, 1298,  2301\n                              \n\n(1992);  United States  v. Rivera-Santiago,  872 F.2d  1073, 1079\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 492  U.S. 910 (1989).

Glover, 814 F.2d  15, 16\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir.  1987) (citations and quotation  marks omitted); accord\n                                                                 \n\nUnited  States v.

See, e.g.,  David, 940 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  735;  Glover,  814 F.2d  at  16-17.   In  the  last analysis,\n                \n\ncriminal  juries are  not expected  to ignore  what  is perfectly\n\nobvious.  See United States  v. Ingraham, 832 F.2d 229, 240  (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1009 (1988). \n                        \n\n          In  this  case,  there was  evidence  that,  in a  tiny\n\napartment, within feet of  the sole tenant, law officers  found a\n\ncommercially  exploitable  quantity  of  high-purity  cocaine,  a\n\nmeasuring scale of the sort frequently used by narcotics  dealers\n\nto ply their trade, and a drug ledger (written on the back of the\n\ntenant's pay stub).   Exiting from the room where the cocaine lay\n\nopen  and exposed  was  another man  (Victor  Gallego).   A  jury\n\nviewing this evidence could reasonably conclude that  the two men\n\nhad agreed to disobey the law and distribute cocaine.  Cf., e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nOrtiz,  966  F.2d at  712 (criminals  \"rarely seek  to perpetrate\n     \n\nfelonies   before  larger-than-necessary   audiences\");  Batista-\n                                                                 \n\n                                8\n\nPolanco, 927 F.2d  at 18-19 (similar);  United States v.

Authentication.\n                                          \n\n          Appellant  complains  that  the  government  failed  to\n\nauthenticate  the so-called  drug ledger as  required by  Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 901,  and that, consequently,  the district court  erred in\n\nadmitting  it into  evidence.3     We  review the  trial  court's\n\nrulings concerning authentication  of documents only  for mistake\n\nof  law or  abuse of  discretion.   See Ortiz,  966 F.2d  at 716;\n                                             \n\nUnited States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 956 (1st Cir. 1989).\n                     \n\n          When the authenticity of  a document is challenged, the\n\ncourt must determine whether  there is sufficient threshold proof\n\nthat the  document is what  its proponent claims  it to be.   See\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     3The rule provides in pertinent part:\n\n          The   requirement    of   authentication   or\n          identification  as  a condition  precedent to\n          admissibility   is   satisfied  by   evidence\n          sufficient  to  support  a finding  that  the\n          matter  in  question  is  what  its proponent\n          claims.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 901 (a).\n\n                                9\n\nOrtiz, 966  F.2d at 716.   The Federal Rules of  Evidence adopt a\n     \n\nflexible approach to this question.   Indeed, the applicable rule\n\nsuggests  that the  \"[a]ppearance, contents,  substance, internal\n\npatterns,   or  other   distinctive  characteristics,   taken  in\n\nconjunction  with    circumstances,\"  can  confirm  a  document's\n\nauthenticity.  Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(4).\n\n          In  this instance,  the  government  claimed  that  the\n\nearnings  statement doubled as a drug ledger.  The district court\n\nadmitted the evidence  on that basis.  We discern  no error.  The\n\nearnings  statement was  clearly identified  with Echeverri    it\n\nwas,  after all, a recapitulation  of his wages,  reposing in his\n\napartment.   Federal agents discovered  the document  lying on  a\n\ncouch  within  feet of  a  sizable,  easily  visible  package  of\n\ncocaine.  The column of handwritten figures on the paper totalled\n\n37,000   the approximate  dollar value of the discovered  cocaine\n\nin the  local market.  Finally,  an agent familiar with  the drug\n\ntrade testified on voir dire that he believed the  document was a\n\ndrug  ledger  and gave  persuasive  reasons  in support  of  that\n\nconclusion.  No more was exigible.  \n\n          To be  sure, the  government presented no  direct proof\n\nthat Echeverri  authored the jottings on  the earnings statement.\n\nBut,  such proof was not  a prerequisite to  admissibility in the\n\ncircumstances  at bar.  On  the record before  us, the government\n\nsufficiently connected  the document to the conspiracy and to the\n\nappellant, even though it did not conclusively prove the author's\n\nidentity.  Cf.,  e.g., United  States v. Natale,  526 F.2d  1160,\n                                               \n\n                                10\n\n1173 (2d  Cir. 1975) (holding that,  for authentication, \"[p]roof\n\nof the  connection of an exhibit to the defendants may be made by\n\ncircumstantial, as well as  direct, evidence\"), cert. denied, 425\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  950 (1976).  Whether  Echeverri, his coconspirator, or some\n\nthird person  was the one who actually put pen to paper and wrote\n\ndown the figures is of no moment.  Regardless,  the evidence that\n\nidentified the document as a drug ledger was the key to the issue\n\nof  authentication.  See United  States v. Smith,  918 F.2d 1501,\n                                                \n\n1510 (11th Cir. 1990),  cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 151,  253 (1991);\n                                    \n\nUnited States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 26 (1st Cir. 1984).4\n                        \n\n                      B.  Expert Testimony.\n                                           \n\n          Appellant also  contends that the  district court erred\n\nin allowing agent Ghio  to offer opinion evidence anent  the drug\n\nledger.  His contention is unavailing.  \n\n          We have consistently  recognized that academic training\n\nis  not a  sine  qua  non  of  expert  knowledge  concerning  the\n\n                    \n\n     4The cases  cited by appellant  in support of  his challenge\nare  readily distinguishable.   In both United  States v. Mouzin,\n                                                                \n785 F.2d  682 (9th Cir.), cert.  denied, 479 U.S. 985  (1986) and\n                                       \nUnited  States  v. Ordonez,  737 F.2d  793  (9th Cir.  1983), the\n                          \ngovernment   argued  that  intricately   detailed  writings  were\nproperly  admitted into evidence to prove the truth of the matter\nasserted  therein because    the  writings  were  coconspirators'\nstatements or statements of  a party opponent.  In  this context,\nthe  Ninth Circuit found error  because there was  no evidence of\nactual authorship and, therefore, no foundation for the admission\nof such statements.   See Mouzin, 785  F.2d at 692; Ordonez,  737\n                                                           \nF.2d at 800-02; see also  Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).   In contrast,\n                        \nthere  has  been  no suggestion  in  the  instant  case that  the\ndocument was admitted to  prove the truth of the  matter asserted\ntherein.   Rather, the  jottings on this  sheet are  more akin to\nphysical  evidence  of  the   crime  than  to  potential  hearsay\nstatements.   See, e.g., United  States v. Wilson,  532 F.2d 641,\n                                                 \n645-46 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 846 (1976).  \n                               \n\n                                11\n\npractices  of  hard-core drug  traffickers.    See, e.g.,  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Hoffman, 832  F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir. 1987).  Perhaps\n                 \n\nrealizing  the  durability  of  this tenet,  appellant  does  not\n\nquestion Ghio's qualifications to serve as an expert witness.  He\n\ndoes, however, question the need for expert testimony.\n\n          In   deciding  whether  to  admit  or  exclude  opinion\n\nevidence, courts  must assess  whether the testimony  will likely\n\nassist  the jury in  understanding the proof  or ascertaining the\n\nfacts.    See Fed.  R.  Evid. 702.    Because  of its  first-hand\n             \n\nacquaintance with  the case, the trial court  enjoys broad leeway\n\nin making this discretionary determination.  The court of appeals\n\nwill overturn a \n\ntrial-level determination  about the  need  for expert  testimony\n\nonly  if a manifest  abuse of the trial  court's discretion is in\n\nprospect.  See Ladd, 885 F.2d  at 959; Hoffman, 832 F.2d at 1310.\n                                              \n\n          Here,  the  central  issue   on  count  2  was  whether\n\nappellant   was     or  was  not     a  knowing  and  intentional\n\nparticipant  in  a  cocaine  conspiracy.   Ghio's  testimony  was\n\nclearly  relevant to  that issue.   Moreover,  the testimony  was\n\nundoubtedly helpful to  the jury.   Laymen, on  average, are  not\n\nfamiliar with the praxis of the cocaine community.  See Ladd, 885\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 960.  It follows that a trial court may allow a qualified\n\nexpert to  identify an otherwise  inscrutable document as  a drug\n\nledger and explain  its contents.   See, e.g.,  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nCampino, 890 F.2d 588, 593 (2d Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n                                12\n\n1068, (1990); United States v. Diaz, 878 F.2d 608, 619 (2d  Cir),\n                                   \n\ncert. denied, 493 U.S.  993 (1989); United States v.  DeSoto, 885\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 354, 362 (7th Cir.  1989); see also United States v.  Rubio-\n                                                                 \n\nEstrada, 857 F.2d 845 (1st Cir. 1988) (noting approvingly, albeit\n       \n\nwithout considering the issue raised by this  appellant, that the\n\njury had before it  the expert testimony of a  government witness\n\nwho identified and  explained a  drug ledger).   The lower  court\n\nacted  well within the encincture of its discretion in permitting\n\nthe use of such evidence here.5      \n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need   go  no  further.     The  government  proved\n\nEcheverri's  guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in a trial free from\n\nreversible \n\nerror.  The judgment below is therefore\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    \n\n     5We  note  that the  district  court  wisely instructed  the\njurors  that   agent  Ghio's  opinion   testimony,  like  opinion\ntestimony generally, was not binding upon them.\n\n                                13\n",

Discerning no error, we affirm.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          We  limn the facts in  the light most  favorable to the\n\ngovernment, consistent  with record  support.  See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Maraj, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570481\"><a href=\"/opinion/570481/united-states-v-michael-maraj-united-states-of-america-v-sterling/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (1st Cir. 1991).\n               \n\n          Armed with a  search warrant, a team of law enforcement\n\nofficers  including FBI  Special  Agent  Frederick  Ghio  entered\n\nappellant's  apartment in  Pawtucket, Rhode  Island.   The living\n\nquarters consisted of a narrow bedroom, a multi-purpose room, and\n\na bathroom, having a total combined area roughly equal to that of\n\na  one-car garage.  When  the agents arrived,  Victor Gallego was\n\nleaving the bathroom  and appellant was seated at a  table in the\n\nmulti-purpose room.  Next to appellant, on the couch and in plain\n\nview, lay an earnings statement in his name.  On the back of this\n\nstatement  was a  handwritten column  of numbers  arrayed  in the\n\nfollowing fashion:\n\n                                2\n\n           1000\n           2000\n          17000\n           1000\n          10000\n           4000\n           1000\n               \n          34000\n\n          In  the course of the ensuing search the agents found a\n\ntape-wrapped  block  of cocaine     eighty-six  percent pure  and\n\nweighing about  two pounds    on the  toilet lid.   The tape  had\n\nbroken and the contraband  was exposed.  An electronic  scale lay\n\nnearby. \n\n          Gallego  and Echeverri were  charged with possession of\n\ncocaine with  intent to distribute  it, 21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1);\n\n841(b)(1)(B), and  with  participating  in  a  drug  distribution\n\nconspiracy.  21 U.S.C.   846.  Gallego  pled guilty and Echeverri\n\nstood trial alone.  Over his objection, the government introduced\n\nthe earnings statement  into evidence.   The court allowed  agent\n\nGhio to  testify that, in  his opinion, the  reverse side  of the\n\nstatement  comprised  a  drug  ledger  (the   individual  figures\n\ncorresponding to  per-ounce prices  for various cocaine  sales in\n\nthe Rhode Island  market).   Ghio further testified  that it  was\n\ncommon  for  cocaine  dealers  to  keep  their  accounts in  such\n\nfashion;  that the going price for cocaine was $35,000 to $40,000\n\nper  kilogram; that the total shown on the earnings statement, if\n\ninterpreted to mean \"dollars\" and  added correctly,1 corresponded\n\n                    \n\n     1The column  of figures, added  correctly, totalled  37,000,\nnot 34,000.  We consider this mathematical mishap unimportant.\n\n                                3\n\nin rough proportion  to the  gross sales price  of the  aggregate\n\ncocaine  on hand; and that  the quantity of  narcotics seized was\n\ninconsistent with personal use.\n\n          The  jury convicted  Echeverri  on both  counts.   This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\nII.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n          Appellant labors to convince us that the judgment below\n\nrests  on  too fragile  an evidentiary  foundation.   We  are not\n\npersuaded.\n\n                     A.  Standard of Review.\n                                            \n\n          The  standard of  review applicable  to sufficiency-of-\n\nthe-evidence  challenges is  settled.   An  appellate court  must\n\nexamine  the  evidence  in  the  light  most  flattering  to  the\n\nprosecution, indulging all reasonable inferences in its favor and\n\nthen determining  whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.  See, e.g., Maraj, 947 F.2d at 522-23; United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Boylan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span>\n                                                            \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990).   In making this determination, the  court must\n\ncredit both direct and  circumstantial evidence   and it  must do\n\nso without evaluating the relative  weight of different pieces of\n\nproof  or   venturing  credibility   judgments.

The  attendant circumstances\n\ntell the tale    and  the culpability of  a defendant's  presence\n\nhinges upon whether the circumstances fairly imply  participatory\n\ninvolvement.    In other  words,  a  defendant's \"mere  presence\"\n\nargument will fail in situations where the \"mere\" is lacking.  \n\n          This is such  a situation.   There is  far more to  the\n\nprosecution's case against Echeverri  than his corporeal presence\n\nin the apartment.  A rational jury, drawing reasonable inferences\n\nfrom proven facts, could certainly have concluded that this was a\n\ncase of culpable presence as opposed to mere presence, see Ortiz,\n                                                                \n\n                                5\n\n966 F.2d at 712, and that appellant was in knowing possession  of\n\nthe contraband at the time of the raid.  We explain briefly.\n\n          Both constructive  possession and guilty  knowledge may\n\nbe  inferred from a defendant's dominion and control over an area\n\nwhere narcotics are  found.  See, e.g., Barnes, 890  F.2d at 549.\n                                              \n\nIn this  instance, there is considerable evidence of dominion and\n\ncontrol.  Appellant  concedes that the  apartment was his  abode.\n\nHis  rent receipts,  passport,  and other  personal effects  were\n\nstrewn about  the premises.  As the  lessee of the apartment, and\n\nthe one who  called it  home, appellant was  hardly powerless  to\n\ndetermine who and what could come inside.2\n\n          Moreover, the  entire apartment consisted  of a  small,\n\ncramped space.  The  cocaine was in plain view, resting openly on\n\nthe  dwelling's  only  toilet.   Tools  of  the  drug trade  were\n\nconspicuously  displayed.     Echeverri  himself  was  physically\n\npresent, seated within four feet of  the contraband.  All in all,\n\nthe  totality of  the circumstances  suffices  to support  both a\n\nfinding  of  constructive  possession  and a  finding  of  guilty\n\nknowledge.  See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez-Torres,     F.2d\n                                                       \n\n   ,      [No. 91-2140, slip op. at 2-6]; Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 713-\n                                               \n\n14;  United  States v.

Indeed, the applicable rule\n\nsuggests  that the  \"[a]ppearance, contents,  substance, internal\n\npatterns,   or  other   distinctive  characteristics,   taken  in\n\nconjunction  with    circumstances,\"  can  confirm  a  document's\n\nauthenticity.  Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(4).\n\n          In  this instance,  the  government  claimed  that  the\n\nearnings  statement doubled as a drug ledger.  The district court\n\nadmitted the evidence  on that basis.  We discern  no error.  The\n\nearnings  statement was  clearly identified  with Echeverri    it\n\nwas,  after all, a recapitulation  of his wages,  reposing in his\n\napartment.   Federal agents discovered  the document  lying on  a\n\ncouch  within  feet of  a  sizable,  easily  visible  package  of\n\ncocaine.  The column of handwritten figures on the paper totalled\n\n37,000   the approximate  dollar value of the discovered  cocaine\n\nin the  local market.  Finally,  an agent familiar with  the drug\n\ntrade testified on voir dire that he believed the  document was a\n\ndrug  ledger  and gave  persuasive  reasons  in support  of  that\n\nconclusion.  No more was exigible.  \n\n          To be  sure, the  government presented no  direct proof\n\nthat Echeverri  authored the jottings on  the earnings statement.\n\nBut,  such proof was not  a prerequisite to  admissibility in the\n\ncircumstances  at bar.  On  the record before  us, the government\n\nsufficiently connected  the document to the conspiracy and to the\n\nappellant, even though it did not conclusively prove the author's\n\nidentity.

In  this context,\nthe  Ninth Circuit found error  because there was  no evidence of\nactual authorship and, therefore, no foundation for the admission\nof such statements.   See Mouzin, 785  F.2d at 692; Ordonez,  737\n                                                           \nF.2d at 800-02; see also  Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).   In contrast,\n                        \nthere  has  been  no suggestion  in  the  instant  case that  the\ndocument was admitted to  prove the truth of the  matter asserted\ntherein.   Rather, the  jottings on this  sheet are  more akin to\nphysical  evidence  of  the   crime  than  to  potential  hearsay\nstatements.   See, e.g., United  States v.

Perhaps\n                 \n\nrealizing  the  durability  of  this tenet,  appellant  does  not\n\nquestion Ghio's qualifications to serve as an expert witness.  He\n\ndoes, however, question the need for expert testimony.\n\n          In   deciding  whether  to  admit  or  exclude  opinion\n\nevidence, courts  must assess  whether the testimony  will likely\n\nassist  the jury in  understanding the proof  or ascertaining the\n\nfacts.    See Fed.  R.  Evid. 702.    Because  of its  first-hand\n             \n\nacquaintance with  the case, the trial court  enjoys broad leeway\n\nin making this discretionary determination.  The court of appeals\n\nwill overturn a \n\ntrial-level determination  about the  need  for expert  testimony\n\nonly  if a manifest  abuse of the trial  court's discretion is in\n\nprospect.  See Ladd, 885 F.2d  at 959; Hoffman, 832 F.2d at 1310.\n                                              \n\n          Here,  the  central  issue   on  count  2  was  whether\n\nappellant   was     or  was  not     a  knowing  and  intentional\n\nparticipant  in  a  cocaine  conspiracy.   Ghio's  testimony  was\n\nclearly  relevant to  that issue.   Moreover,  the testimony  was\n\nundoubtedly helpful to  the jury.   Laymen, on  average, are  not\n\nfamiliar with the praxis of the cocaine community.  See Ladd, 885\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 960.  It follows that a trial court may allow a qualified\n\nexpert to  identify an otherwise  inscrutable document as  a drug\n\nledger and explain  its contents.
