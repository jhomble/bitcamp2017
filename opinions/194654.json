Finding   appellant's\n\nlamentations to be  without merit, we affirm the sentence imposed\n\nbelow.\n\n                               I.  \n                               I.\n                                 \n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n          In  February 1992, a federal grand jury in the District\n\nof Puerto Rico returned a five-count indictment against a cluster\n\nof  defendants.   Appellant  Richard Ocasio-Rivera  was named  in\n\nthree of the  five counts.   On May  5, 1992, Ocasio-Rivera  pled\n\nguilty to  count 4   a  count charging that, \"[f]rom  on or about\n\nJanuary 11, 1992  and continuing thereafter  up to and  including\n\nJanuary  24,   1992,\"  he  and  his   codefendants  conspired  to\n\ndistribute four kilograms of cocaine to an undercover agent.  The\n\ncourt  ordered the  preparation  of  a presentence  investigation\n\nreport (PSI Report).\n\n          At a  sentencing hearing held  on August 21,  1992, the\n\ndistrict judge  determined the  guideline sentencing range  to be\n\n97-121 months (offense level 30; criminal history category I) and\n\nimposed  an  incarcerative  sentence slightly  below  the range's\n\nmidpoint.1  This appeal ensued.\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     1The other charges against  appellant, contained in counts 1\nand 5, were dismissed.\n\n                                2\n\n          Ocasio-Rivera's appeal hinges  on three assignments  of\n\nerror.  We discuss them seriatim.\n                                \n\n                                A.\n                                  \n\n              The Alleged Sixth Amendment Violation\n                                                   \n\n          Appellant contends that he had a right, under the Sixth\n\nAmendment,2  to have  his  attorney present  during his  audience\n\nwith  the  probation officer;  that  he sought  to  exercise this\n\nright;  that the  interview  nonetheless  proceeded in  counsel's\n\nabsence;  and that,  therefore,  appellant's  sentence should  be\n\nvacated because it was based, in part, upon information  winnowed\n\nfrom him  during the uncounselled  interview and included  in the\n\nPSI  Report.   This contention  is reminiscent  of a  seldom used\n\nketchup bottle:  at first glance, it looks full    but, even when\n\ntipped, slammed, and forcibly shaken, it is very difficult to get\n\nanything out of it.\n\n          The facts are these.  At  the change-of-plea hearing on\n\nMay 5,  1992, appellant and  his lawyer were  advised that  a PSI\n\nReport  would be  compiled.   On May  22, the  probation officer,\n\nAntonio Bruno, confirmed  in writing that  he was performing  the\n\nrequired investigation.  Defense  counsel admits that he received\n\nthis billet-doux no later than May 26.\n\n          On June 8,  Bruno interviewed appellant.  At that time,\n\n                    \n\n     2The Sixth Amendment provides in pertinent part:\n\n          In  all  criminal  prosecutions, the  accused\n          shall  enjoy  the right  .  . .  to  have the\n          Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\n\nU.S. Const. amend. VI.\n\n                                3\n\nappellant  lodged no  objection to  proceeding in  his attorney's\n\nabsence.  It was not until June 10   two days after the interview\n\nhad  been completed     that Bruno  received  a letter  from  the\n\nattorney  asking  for the  first time  to  be present  when Bruno\n                                     \n\nquestioned  his client.    At the  sentencing hearing,  appellant\n\nneither alleged a Sixth  Amendment violation nor moved to  strike\n\nthe uncounselled statements.\n\n          It is a  bedrock principle in this circuit  that issues\n\nmust be squarely  raised in the district court if  they are to be\n\npreserved for appeal.   See,  e.g., United States  v. Slade,  980\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992); United  States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1020, 1025 (1st Cir. 1987).  That principle  applies unreservedly\n\nin  the criminal sentencing context.  See United States v. Ortiz,\n                                                                \n\n966 F.2d 707, 717 (1st  Cir. 1992), cert. denied 113 S.  Ct. 1005\n                                                \n\n(1993); United States v.  Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55  (1st Cir. 1991)\n                               \n\n(collecting cases); United States v. Pilgrim Mkt. Corp., 944 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n14, 21 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Argentine, 814 F.2d 783,\n                                                  \n\n790-91 (1st Cir. 1987).  There is, to be sure, a narrow exception\n\nfor  unusually   compelling  circumstances,  but  it   is  to  be\n\n\"exercised sparingly,\" mainly  in instances where  the previously\n\nomitted ground will ensure appellant's success and thus prevent a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.  See Slade, 980 F.2d at 31; United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Krynicki, 689 F.2d 289, 291-92 (1st Cir. 1982).\n           \n\n          That  ends  the  matter.   On  even  the  most generous\n\nreading  of the  record, it  is pellucidly  clear that  the Sixth\n\nAmendment  argument was  never called  to the  sentencing court's\n\n                                4\n\nattention.   Because  the issue  was not  distinctly raised  in a\n\ntimely  fashion in  the court  below, and  because the  attendant\n\ncircumstances  are  manifestly   insufficient  to  overcome  this\n\nprocedural  default,3 we conclude that  the issue is not properly\n\nbefore us.  Consequently, the assignment of error fails.\n\n                                B.\n                                  \n\n                       Role in the Offense\n                                          \n\n          The court below rejected appellant's plea that he was a\n\n\"minor\"  or \"minimal\"  participant in  the conspiracy  and, thus,\n\ndeserving  of a reduction in  the offense level  under U.S.S.G.  \n\n3B1.2  (Nov.   1991).     As   with   other   sentence-decreasing\n\nadjustments, a defendant must shoulder the burden of  proving his\n\nentitlement  to a  downward role-in-the-offense adjustment.   See\n                                                                 \n\nOrtiz,  966 F.2d at  717; United States v.  Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330,\n                                                  \n\n                    \n\n     3We pause to mention two of the several factors that counsel\nagainst  relaxing  the  raise-or-waive  rule  in  this  instance.\nFirst,  the interests of judicial economy would be poorly served;\nthis issue is  unlikely to arise again in  the District of Puerto\nRico  because  the  probation  department's policy  is  to  allow\ndefense  counsel to  attend  presentence  interviews upon  timely\nrequest.  Second, although we leave  the question open, we do not\nfind appellant's argument \"highly persuasive,\" Krynicki, 689 F.2d\n                                                       \nat 292,  at least at first  blush.  Four circuits  have held that\nthere  is  no  constitutional  right  to  counsel  at  a  routine\npresentence  interview in a non-capital case.   See United States\n                                                                 \nv. Tisdale, 952  F.2d 934, 940 (6th Cir. 1992);  United States v.\n                                                              \nJohnson, 935 F.2d 47, 50 (4th Cir.),  cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 609\n                                                  \n(1991); United States  v. Woods,  907 F.2d 1540,  1543 (5th  Cir.\n                               \n1990), cert.  denied,  111 S.Ct.  792  (1991); United  States  v.\n                                                             \nJackson, 886  F.2d 838, 844-45 (7th  Cir. 1989).   No circuit has\n       \nruled  to the  contrary    although  the  Ninth Circuit,  without\nreaching  the   constitutional   question,  has   exercised   its\nsupervisory powers to \"direct that probation officers be required\nto  permit defendants' counsel to accompany  their clients at the\npresentence interview.\"   United States  v. Herrero-Figueroa, 918\n                                                            \nF.2d 1430, 1433 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\n                                5\n\n332 (1st Cir. 1990).   Reviewing the  record in its entirety,  we\n\nthink the  sentencing court  was amply  justified in  refusing to\n\nlabel  appellant a  minor  or minimal  participant.   We  explain\n\nbriefly.  \n\n          Based  on  the  facts  contained  in  PSI  Report,  the\n\nsentencing court  could supportably  have found that,  on January\n\n10,  1992,  appellant  and  a  codefendant,  Juan  Mercado  Lopez\n\n(Mercado), together negotiated an anticipated multi-kilogram sale\n\nof cocaine to  an undercover agent;  that the two  men agreed  to\n\nsell three ounces as  a sample; that appellant remained  with the\n\nprospective purchaser  while  Mercado fetched  the  sample;  that\n\nappellant repeatedly assured the  \"customer\" about the quality of\n\nthe cocaine and the availability of the larger quantity for which\n\nthe trio had been  dickering; that the sample was  delivered; and\n\nthat, eleven days later,  appellant received the purchaser's call\n\nthat he was  ready to close  the deal.   The capture trap  sprang\n\nshut as consummation neared.\n\n          Although appellant  strives  to portray  himself  as  a\n\nminnow  in  service to  a big  fish  (Mercado), his  portrayal is\n\nunconvincing.  The facts set out above, in the ensemble,  paint a\n\npicture  of appellant  as far  more than  a minnow.   The logical\n\ninference   and the  one apparently adopted by the court  below  \n\nis that the two  men were roughly equal partners,  sharing risks,\n\nresponsibilities,  and rewards.    On this  basis,  we think  the\n\ndistrict court acted well  within its proper province  in finding\n\nthat  appellant's role was neither minor nor minimal.  See United\n                                                                 \n\n                                6\n\nStates  v. St. Cyr,  977 F.2d 698,  706 (1st Cir.  1992) (holding\n                  \n\nthat  \"when  there are  two plausible  views  of the  record, the\n\nsentencing court's  adoption of one  such view cannot  be clearly\n\nerroneous\"); United States v.  Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508  (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1990) (similar).\n\n          Appellant's  principal  rejoinder  is that,  since  the\n\nJanuary  10, 1992  \"sample sale\" was  the subject of  count 1 and\n\nsince count 1  was dismissed, see supra note 1,  the judge should\n                                       \n\nnot have  taken the evidence into  account.  We disagree.   It is\n\nwell settled in the criminal law that evidence of prior uncharged\n\nconduct  (or, as  here, evidence  of prior  conduct related  to a\n\ndefunct  count) is relevant and admissible  to complete the story\n\nof a charged crime by illuminating the chain of events leading up\n\nto the charged crime and the context in which the crime occurred.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 286, 287-88 (1st\n                                 \n\nCir. 1990); United States v. Reveron-Martinez,  836 F.2d 684, 688\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir. 1988); United States v.  Currier, 821 F.2d 52, 55 (1st\n                                           \n\nCir. 1987).  So here.  The January 10 sale, involving, as it did,\n\na  sample  for  the  larger  transaction  that  the  parties were\n\ncontemplating, was  in the nature of a  dress rehearsal.  It was,\n\ntherefore, eminently reasonable for the judge to extrapolate from\n\nthe events  of  January  10 in  deducing  the  appellant's  place\n\nwithin, and relationship to, the conspiracy charged in count 4.\n\n                                C.\n                                  \n\n                   Acceptance of Responsibility\n                                               \n\n          U.S.S.G.   3E1.1 (Nov.  1991) allows a sentencing court\n\n                                7\n\nto bestow a  two-level downward adjustment  upon a defendant  who\n\naccepts  responsibility.   The  ultimate  question under  section\n\n3E1.1 is not whether the defendant has uttered  \"a pat recital of\n\nthe  vocabulary of contrition,\"  but whether he has accepted full\n\nresponsibility for  his  part in  the  offense of  conviction  by\n\ndemonstrating \"candor  and authentic remorse.\"   United States v.\n                                                              \n\nRoyer,  895 F.2d  28, 30  (1st Cir.  1990); accord,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

The\n                        \n\ndefendant  has  the  burden  of  proving  his  entitlement  to an\n\nacceptance-of-responsibility credit,  see  Bradley, 917  F.2d  at\n                                                  \n\n606,  and the  sentencing court's  determination to  withhold the\n\nreduction will  be overturned  only if  it is clearly  erroneous.\n\nSee Royer, 895 F.2d at 29.\n         \n\n          We have placed a  gloss on the use of  section 3E1.1 in\n\nmultiple-count cases.  In United States v. Perez-Franco, 873 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n455  (1st Cir.  1989),  we held  that,  in  order to  obtain  the\n\nreduction, a  defendant   \"must accept responsibility  solely for\n\nthe counts to which he  is pleading guilty.\"  Id. at 463.   Here,\n                                                 \n\nappellant  unsuccessfully sought  an acceptance-of-responsibility\n\ndiscount in  the court  below.  On  appeal, he contends  that the\n\ndistrict judge transgressed the Perez-Franco rule, denying relief\n                                            \n\nbecause he,  appellant, would  not accept responsibility  for the\n\nnefarious conduct  underlying the  dismissed counts.   The record\n\nbelies the contention.\n\n          As   indicated  previously,   see  supra   Part  II(B),\n                                                  \n\n                                8\n\nappellant labored at sentencing to convince the court that he was\n\na mere tagalong  in a  conspiracy orchestrated by  Mercado.   The\n\njudge debunked this account and found instead that  appellant, by\n\nproclaiming  he  was  a tagalong  when  he  was  actually a  full\n\npartner, had engaged in a campaign to minimize his involvement in\n                                                                 \n\nthe offense of  conviction.  It was on that  basis that the lower\n                          \n\ncourt denied the downward adjustment.  We discern no error.\n\n          Where a defendant resorts  to evasions, distortions, or\n\nhalf-truths  in an  effort to  minimize his  culpability, whether\n\nduring a presentence interview or in his allocution, the district\n\ncourt may  appropriately  decide to  withhold  an  acceptance-of-\n\nresponsibility credit under section 3E1.1.  See United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nReyes, 927 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 1991); Bradley, 917 F.2d at 606;\n                                               \n\nsee  also United  States v.  Chalkias, 971  F.2d 1206,  1216 (6th\n                                     \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 351 (1992).  This case is cast in\n                   \n\nthat  mold.   The sentencing  court made  an explicit  finding of\n\nconscious minimization   a  finding that was adequately supported\n\nby the  record and not vulnerable to clear-error attack.  No more\n\nwas exigible.\n\n                               III.\n                                   \n\n                            Conclusion\n                                      \n\n          We need go no further.  The  ketchup bottle is dry (or,\n\nat  least,  congealed)  and  the other  condiments  served  up by\n\nappellant  lack zest.    Having tasted  the  full flavor  of  the\n\nunseasoned appeal,  we  conclude that  appellant's  sentence  was\n\nlawful.\n\n                                9\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                10\n",

Finding   appellant's\n\nlamentations to be  without merit, we affirm the sentence imposed\n\nbelow.\n\n                               I.  \n                               I.\n                                 \n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n          In  February 1992, a federal grand jury in the District\n\nof Puerto Rico returned a five-count indictment against a cluster\n\nof  defendants.   Appellant  Richard Ocasio-Rivera  was named  in\n\nthree of the  five counts.   On May  5, 1992, Ocasio-Rivera  pled\n\nguilty to  count 4   a  count charging that, \"[f]rom  on or about\n\nJanuary 11, 1992  and continuing thereafter  up to and  including\n\nJanuary  24,   1992,\"  he  and  his   codefendants  conspired  to\n\ndistribute four kilograms of cocaine to an undercover agent.  The\n\ncourt  ordered the  preparation  of  a presentence  investigation\n\nreport (PSI Report).\n\n          At a  sentencing hearing held  on August 21,  1992, the\n\ndistrict judge  determined the  guideline sentencing range  to be\n\n97-121 months (offense level 30; criminal history category I) and\n\nimposed  an  incarcerative  sentence slightly  below  the range's\n\nmidpoint.1  This appeal ensued.\n\n                               II.\n                                  \n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\n                    \n\n     1The other charges against  appellant, contained in counts 1\nand 5, were dismissed.\n\n                                2\n\n          Ocasio-Rivera's appeal hinges  on three assignments  of\n\nerror.  We discuss them seriatim.\n                                \n\n                                A.\n                                  \n\n              The Alleged Sixth Amendment Violation\n                                                   \n\n          Appellant contends that he had a right, under the Sixth\n\nAmendment,2  to have  his  attorney present  during his  audience\n\nwith  the  probation officer;  that  he sought  to  exercise this\n\nright;  that the  interview  nonetheless  proceeded in  counsel's\n\nabsence;  and that,  therefore,  appellant's  sentence should  be\n\nvacated because it was based, in part, upon information  winnowed\n\nfrom him  during the uncounselled  interview and included  in the\n\nPSI  Report.   This contention  is reminiscent  of a  seldom used\n\nketchup bottle:  at first glance, it looks full    but, even when\n\ntipped, slammed, and forcibly shaken, it is very difficult to get\n\nanything out of it.\n\n          The facts are these.  At  the change-of-plea hearing on\n\nMay 5,  1992, appellant and  his lawyer were  advised that  a PSI\n\nReport  would be  compiled.   On May  22, the  probation officer,\n\nAntonio Bruno, confirmed  in writing that  he was performing  the\n\nrequired investigation.  Defense  counsel admits that he received\n\nthis billet-doux no later than May 26.\n\n          On June 8,  Bruno interviewed appellant.  At that time,\n\n                    \n\n     2The Sixth Amendment provides in pertinent part:\n\n          In  all  criminal  prosecutions, the  accused\n          shall  enjoy  the right  .  . .  to  have the\n          Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\n\nU.S. Const. amend. VI.\n\n                                3\n\nappellant  lodged no  objection to  proceeding in  his attorney's\n\nabsence.  It was not until June 10   two days after the interview\n\nhad  been completed     that Bruno  received  a letter  from  the\n\nattorney  asking  for the  first time  to  be present  when Bruno\n                                     \n\nquestioned  his client.    At the  sentencing hearing,  appellant\n\nneither alleged a Sixth  Amendment violation nor moved to  strike\n\nthe uncounselled statements.\n\n          It is a  bedrock principle in this circuit  that issues\n\nmust be squarely  raised in the district court if  they are to be\n\npreserved for appeal.

On  even  the  most generous\n\nreading  of the  record, it  is pellucidly  clear that  the Sixth\n\nAmendment  argument was  never called  to the  sentencing court's\n\n                                4\n\nattention.   Because  the issue  was not  distinctly raised  in a\n\ntimely  fashion in  the court  below, and  because the  attendant\n\ncircumstances  are  manifestly   insufficient  to  overcome  this\n\nprocedural  default,3 we conclude that  the issue is not properly\n\nbefore us.

As   with   other   sentence-decreasing\n\nadjustments, a defendant must shoulder the burden of  proving his\n\nentitlement  to a  downward role-in-the-offense adjustment.

Reviewing the  record in its entirety,  we\n\nthink the  sentencing court  was amply  justified in  refusing to\n\nlabel  appellant a  minor  or minimal  participant.   We  explain\n\nbriefly.  \n\n          Based  on  the  facts  contained  in  PSI  Report,  the\n\nsentencing court  could supportably  have found that,  on January\n\n10,  1992,  appellant  and  a  codefendant,  Juan  Mercado  Lopez\n\n(Mercado), together negotiated an anticipated multi-kilogram sale\n\nof cocaine to  an undercover agent;  that the two  men agreed  to\n\nsell three ounces as  a sample; that appellant remained  with the\n\nprospective purchaser  while  Mercado fetched  the  sample;  that\n\nappellant repeatedly assured the  \"customer\" about the quality of\n\nthe cocaine and the availability of the larger quantity for which\n\nthe trio had been  dickering; that the sample was  delivered; and\n\nthat, eleven days later,  appellant received the purchaser's call\n\nthat he was  ready to close  the deal.   The capture trap  sprang\n\nshut as consummation neared.\n\n          Although appellant  strives  to portray  himself  as  a\n\nminnow  in  service to  a big  fish  (Mercado), his  portrayal is\n\nunconvincing.  The facts set out above, in the ensemble,  paint a\n\npicture  of appellant  as far  more than  a minnow.   The logical\n\ninference   and the  one apparently adopted by the court  below  \n\nis that the two  men were roughly equal partners,  sharing risks,\n\nresponsibilities,  and rewards.    On this  basis,  we think  the\n\ndistrict court acted well  within its proper province  in finding\n\nthat  appellant's role was neither minor nor minimal.

So here.  The January 10 sale, involving, as it did,\n\na  sample  for  the  larger  transaction  that  the  parties were\n\ncontemplating, was  in the nature of a  dress rehearsal.

Here,\n                                                 \n\nappellant  unsuccessfully sought  an acceptance-of-responsibility\n\ndiscount in  the court  below.

The record\n\nbelies the contention.\n\n          As   indicated  previously,   see  supra   Part  II(B),\n                                                  \n\n                                8\n\nappellant labored at sentencing to convince the court that he was\n\na mere tagalong  in a  conspiracy orchestrated by  Mercado.   The\n\njudge debunked this account and found instead that  appellant, by\n\nproclaiming  he  was  a tagalong  when  he  was  actually a  full\n\npartner, had engaged in a campaign to minimize his involvement in\n                                                                 \n\nthe offense of  conviction.  It was on that  basis that the lower\n                          \n\ncourt denied the downward adjustment.  We discern no error.\n\n          Where a defendant resorts  to evasions, distortions, or\n\nhalf-truths  in an  effort to  minimize his  culpability, whether\n\nduring a presentence interview or in his allocution, the district\n\ncourt may  appropriately  decide to  withhold  an  acceptance-of-\n\nresponsibility credit under section 3E1.1.
