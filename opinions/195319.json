(hereinafter\n\n\"Alan Corp.\").   The district  court found that  the clean-up\n\ncosts were  not covered  by the  policy, and entered  summary\n\njudgment in favor of ISLIC.

As part  of its business,  it stores\n\noil in large tanks at several different locations.  On August\n\n28, 1986,  Alan Corp.  obtained a pollution  liability policy\n\n(\"the  policy\")  from  ISLIC   in  order  to  insure  against\n\npotential  liability arising  from storage  tank leaks.   The\n\npolicy  covered two Alan  Corp. storage sites  located in the\n\nMassachusetts towns of Leominster and Fitchburg.  \n\n          The policy  was a  one-year \"claims made\"  policy,1\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  Supreme Court has  explained that \"[a]n `occurrence'\npolicy protects the  policy holder from liability for any act\ndone while the policy  is in effect, whereas a  `claims made'\npolicy protects  the holder  only against claims  made during\nthe life of the policy.\"  St. Paul  Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Thus, \"`a doctor  who\n     \npracticed  for only one year,  say 1972, would  need only one\n1972 \"occurrence\" policy  to be fully  covered, but he  would\nneed  several  years of  \"claims  made\"  policies to  protect\nhimself from claims arising  out of his acts in  1972.'\"  Id.\n                                                             \n(quoting Barry v.

In relevant part, the policy stated:\n\n          The  company  will reimburse  the insured\n          for  reasonable  and  necessary  clean-up\n          costs  incurred  by  the  insured  in the\n          discharge of a  legal obligation  validly\n          imposed through governmental action which\n                                                   \n          is initiated during the policy period . .\n                                               \n          . . \n(Emphasis  supplied).  The policy ran from August 28, 1986 to\n\nAugust 28, 1987.    \n\n          On  or about  August 25,  1987, just  prior to  the\n\nexpiration  of  the  policy,   Alan  Corp.  became  aware  of\n\npotential  contamination  at  its  Fitchburg  and  Leominster\n\nfacilities.   In apparent partial compliance  with state fire\n\nregulations,2  David White,  an  Alan Corp.  employee, phoned\n\nthe  Leominster  Fire  Department  and  notified  it  of  the\n\npotential  contamination  at the  Leominster  site.   A  Fire\n\nDepartment   employee   told    White   to   determine   what\n\ncontamination,  if  any,  existed  and  to  report  any  such\n\ncontamination    to    the   Massachusetts    Department   of\n\nEnvironmental   Quality  Engineering,   now   known  as   the\n\n                    \n\n3, 5 n.1 (1st Cir. 1977)).\n\n2.  The Massachusetts Board  of Fire Prevention  Regulations,\nMass. Regs. Code tit.  527,   9.19(1)(b) (1986) provided,  in\nrelevant part, \"In  the event of a  leak . .  . the owner  or\noperator shall immediately notify the head  of the local fire\ndepartment and [the Massachusetts Department of Environmental\nProtection].\"\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nMassachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\").\n\nNo   governmental  agency  was   notified  of  the  potential\n\ncontamination of the Fitchburg site at this time.\n\n          Alan  Corp. also  submitted \"Loss Notice\"  forms to\n\nISLIC.  These  forms, dated  August 28, 1987,  stated that  a\n\n\"[p]reliminary survey shows a  pollution problem\" at both the\n\nLeominster and Fitchburg sites.\n\n          Alan  Corp.  alleges that  on  an  unspecified date\n\nafter  the initial  report to  ISLIC of contamination  at the\n\nLeominster  and  Fitchburg   sites,  an  unidentified   ISLIC\n\nemployee told Alan Corp.  to \"lay low\" with respect  to those\n\ntwo  sites until the clean-up  of a third  Alan Corp. storage\n\nsite, located in Worcester, was completed.  (It appears  that\n\nan entirely separate policy issued by ISLIC provided coverage\n\nfor  the Worcester site, that there  was contamination at the\n\nWorcester site, and  that during late  August of 1987,  ISLIC\n\nwas involved with clean-up at the Worcester site).  That same\n\nunidentified employee allegedly assured Alan Corp. that ISLIC\n\nalso would provide coverage for any necessary clean-up of the\n\nLeominster  and  Fitchburg  sites   upon  completion  of  the\n\nWorcester site clean-up.3\n\n                    \n\n3.  Alan   Corp.'s  president,  Joel  Robbins,  swore  in  an\naffidavit  that the  \"lay low\"  comment and  the accompanying\npromise to provide coverage occurred.  He did not specify any\nindividual at ISLIC who  may have made the comments,  nor did\nhe  specify any individual at  Alan Corp. who  may have heard\nthem,  nor any time or  date when the  comments may have been\nmade.   The district court characterized  Alan Corp.'s claims\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          In  addition, ISLIC  assigned  an  investigator  to\n\nassess the  contamination  at the  Leominster  and  Fitchburg\n\nsites.    Toward  that  same end,  Alan  Corp.  hired  Lycott\n\nEnvironmental   Research   Company,   Inc.    (\"Lycott\")   to\n\ninvestigate both sites.\n\n          About two months after these initial responses, the\n\nLycott  investigation revealed  contamination at  both sites.\n\nOn July 12, 1988, approximately  eight months after the  date\n\nof  the Lycott  report  and nearly  eleven  months after  the\n\nexpiration   of  the   policy,   Alan  Corp.   reported   the\n\ncontamination  of the Leominster site to DEP.  On January 11,\n\n1989,  nearly eighteen  months  after the  expiration of  the\n\npolicy,  DEP ordered the clean-up of the Leominster site.  On\n\nMarch 30,  1989, DEP issued  a \"notice of  responsibility\" to\n\nAlan  Corp. for the Leominster site.   Thereafter, Alan Corp.\n\nconducted remedial efforts  as required by  DEP.  The  record\n\ndoes  not  reveal  when  Alan  Corp.  notified   DEP  of  the\n\ncontamination at  the Fitchburg site, but on August 13, 1991,\n\nDEP ordered clean-up at that site and Alan Corp. complied.\n\n                    \n\nwith  regard to these  comments as  \"tenuous,\" Alan  Corp. v.\n                                                          \nInternational Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 823 F. Supp. 33, 42 (D.\n                                    \nMass  1993),  and  we  further  note  that  these  statements\nprobably do not  satisfy Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56(e)'s requirement\nthat affidavits \"set forth such facts  as would be admissible\nin  evidence.\"   Nonetheless,  like  the  district court,  we\nassume for the  purposes of this opinion that  the statements\nwere made.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          Based  on  the foregoing  facts, Alan  Corp. sought\n\nreimbursement from  ISLIC for clean-up costs  incurred at the\n\nLeominster and  Fitchburg sites.   ISLIC denied  coverage and\n\nAlan Corp.  brought suit.  ISLIC moved  for summary judgment,\n\narguing that no governmental action had been initiated within\n\nthe  policy period, as required  by the terms  of the policy.\n\nThe district  court granted summary judgment,  reasoning that\n\nthe call  to the Leominster Fire  Department, standing alone,\n\ndid  not amount  to \"governmental  action which  is initiated\n\nduring the policy period\" and that therefore coverage was not\n\nafforded under the  policy.  See Alan Corp.  v. International\n                                                             \n\nSurplus Lines Ins. Co., 823 F. Supp. 33 (D. Mass. 1993).  \n                      \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  Standard of Review\n                      \n\n          Our review  of a district court's  grant of summary\n\njudgment  is plenary.  Bird  v. Centennial Ins.  Co., 11 F.3d\n                                                    \n\n228, 231 (1st  Cir. 1993).  We read  the record indulging all\n\ninferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n\nLevy  v. FDIC, 7  F.3d 1054, 1056  (1st Cir.  1993).  Summary\n             \n\njudgment  is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as\n\nto  any material  fact and  the moving  party is  entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.  Id.  \n                                 \n\n          Moreover,  where, as  here,  the facts  upon  which\n\nliability is claimed  or denied under an insurance policy are\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nundisputed and  the existence or amount  of liability depends\n\nsolely  upon  a  construction  of the  policy,  the  question\n\npresented  is one of law.   Atlas Pallet,  Inc. v. Gallagher,\n                                                            \n\n725 F.2d  131, 134 (1st Cir. 1984).   As with other questions\n\nof  law,  we  owe  no   deference  to  the  district  court's\n\ninterpretation of  the policy.   Id.  Finally,  neither party\n                                    \n\ndisputes that Massachusetts law applies.\n\nB.  The Call to the Fire Department\n                                   \n\n          Alan Corp.  argues that  because its phone  call to\n\nthe Leominster Fire Department took place within the policy's\n\nclaims period, the  clean-up costs, which were incurred  as a\n\nresult  of  the order  by DEP  some  twenty months  after the\n\nexpiration of  the policy, were nonetheless  \"validly imposed\n\nthrough governmental action which  [was] initiated during the\n\npolicy  period.\"  In essence, Alan Corp. argues that the call\n\nto the Leominster Fire Department was the first of many steps\n\nthat  led to DEP's  clean-up mandate, and  that, because this\n\nfirst  step  was  taken  within  the  policy  period,  timely\n\n\"governmental  action\" had  therefore been  \"initiated.\"   We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            We begin by noting that neither the phone call to\n\nthe Leominster Fire  Department nor any information  conveyed\n\nduring the phone call, imposed any obligation upon Alan Corp.\n\nAt  best, David  White  was informed  by the  Leominster Fire\n\nDepartment  that  Alan Corp.  had  a  duty  to  determine  if\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\ncontamination  existed and that it  had a duty  to report any\n\nsuch  contamination to  DEP.   These duties  existed entirely\n\nindependently of the phone call.   See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 21E,\n                                      \n\n   7 (stating that an owner of  an oil storage site, \"as soon\n\nas he  has knowledge of a release or threat of release of oil\n\nmaterial,  shall immediately  notify  [DEP] thereof\");  Mass.\n\nRegs. Code tit.  527,   9.19(1)(b) (1986) (stating that \"[i]n\n\nthe event  of  a leak  .  . .  the  owner or  operator  shall\n\nimmediately notify  the head of the local fire department and\n                                                             \n\n[DEP]\")  (emphasis  supplied).   Thus,  even  under the  most\n\ngenerous   reading  of  the  policy,  the  Fire  Department's\n\nrecitation  to David  White of  Alan Corp.'s  duty to  report\n\ncontamination to  DEP, without more, does  not constitute the\n\nimposition of any legal obligation. \n\n          Nor was any further governmental action \"initiated\"\n\nthrough  the phone  call to  the Leominster  Fire Department.\n\nThe Fire Department made no record of the phone call; it sent\n\nno  representatives to  the  site;  it  made  no  attempt  to\n\ndetermine whether  Alan Corp. had investigated  the spill; it\n\nmade  no attempt to determine whether Alan Corp. had reported\n\nany contamination to DEP; and it never communicated with DEP,\n\ndirectly  or  otherwise,  about  the  spill  in  any  manner.\n\nRather, all clean-up  costs in this case  were imposed solely\n\nand independently by DEP,  whose involvement, by Alan Corp.'s\n\nown admission, began well after the policy had expired. \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          In  sum,  the phone  call  to  the Leominster  Fire\n\nDepartment  neither  amounted  to,  nor  did  it  \"initiate,\"\n\ngovernmental action for purposes of  the policy.  Rather, all\n\ngovernmental action resulting  in the imposition  of clean-up\n\ncosts  was  initiated by  and  through  DEP.   Because  DEP's\n\nactions were initiated well after the expiration date  of the\n\npolicy, Alan Corp.  was afforded no coverage for its incurred\n\nclean-up costs.\n\nC.  Other Issues\n                \n\n          As  noted above,  an  unidentified  ISLIC  employee\n\nallegedly told Alan  Corp. to  \"lay low\" with  regard to  the\n\ncontamination and went on to  assure Alan Corp. that expenses\n\nfor the  clean-up of both the Leominster  and Fitchburg sites\n\nwould be covered by  ISLIC.  Based on these  statements, Alan\n\nCorp. argues  that the doctrines  of waiver and  estoppel bar\n\nISLIC from denying coverage.  \n\n          In the  context of insurance claims,  waiver is the\n\nvoluntary  and intentional  relinquishment of a  known right.\n\nMerrimack Mut. Fire Ins.  Co. v. Nonoka, 606 N.E.2d  904, 906\n                                       \n\n(Mass.  1993).   It is  well  established that,  whatever the\n\nscope  of waiver in insurance law, \"it does not extend to the\n\nbroadening of coverage, so as to make the policy cover a risk\n\nnot within  its terms.\"   Palumbo  v. Metropolitan  Life Ins.\n                                                             \n\nCo., 199 N.E. 335, 336 (Mass. 1935).  \n   \n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          The policy at issue here covers, inter alia, claims\n                                                     \n\nmade against the insured  which are initiated by governmental\n\naction during the policy  period.  As pointed out  above, the\n             \n\ngovernmental  action at  issue here  was initiated  after the\n                                                         \n\nexpiration of the  policy.   In sum, the  doctrine of  waiver\n\ndoes not operate in  this case to lengthen the period  of the\n\npolicy so as to  include the clean-up costs assessed  by DEP.\n\nAccordingly, Alan Corp.'s waiver argument fails.\n\n          Alan   Corp.'s   estoppel   argument   is   equally\n\nunavailing.   Estoppel in the  insurance context  necessarily\n\nimplies some reasonable,  good-faith reliance by  the insured\n\nupon some act,  conduct or  inaction of the  insurer, to  the\n\ndetriment  of the insured.  See, e.g., O'Blenes v. Zoning Bd.\n                                                             \n\nof Appeals, 492  N.E.2d 354, 356 (Mass. 1986).   As a general\n          \n\nmatter, estoppel,  like waiver,  does not extend,  broaden or\n\nenlarge coverage so  as to include  risks not covered  within\n\nthe terms of the policy.  Cf. Nieves v. Intercontinental Life\n                                                             \n\nIns.  Co., 964  F.2d 60,  66 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (holding that,\n         \n\nunder Puerto Rico law, an insurance policy cannot be extended\n\nby waiver or estoppel).\n            \n\n          Alan Corp. argues that  it would have contacted DEP\n\nwithin  the  claims  period  (and  thus,  presumably,  timely\n\ngovernmental  action  would  have  been  initiated), but  for\n\nISLIC's advice to \"lay low.\"  Alan Corp.'s argument leaves us\n\nto conclude that it was aware, or reasonably should have been\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\naware, of  its statutory and regulatory  obligation to report\n\npotential contamination to DEP.  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 21E,  \n                                    \n\n7; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 527,   9.19(1)(b) (1986).  Moreover,\n\naccording to  Alan Corp.'s own evidence,  the Leominster Fire\n\nDepartment instructed Alan Corp.  to report contamination  to\n                     \n\nDEP.  We agree with the district  court that reliance upon an\n\ninsurance company's  advice not  to report  contamination, in\n\nthe  face of both a  statutory and regulatory  duty to report\n\nsuch contamination and advice from a local fire department to\n                      \n\ndo  so, can be neither reasonable nor  in good faith.  In the\n\nabsence of  good faith  or reasonable reliance,  Alan Corp.'s\n\nestoppel argument fails.\n\n          Finally, Alan Corp. argues  that ISLIC was unfairly\n\ndilatory  in  making  its  determination that  it  would  not\n\nprovide coverage  and that this  delay amounted to  an unfair\n\ntrade practice under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A    2, 11 and Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch. 176D,    3(9)(a-f) and (n).  In order to make out\n\na  claim  under  these  statutes, however,  a  claimant  must\n\nestablish  both that  an unfair  trade practice  occurred and\n                                                             \n\nthat  the unfair practice resulted in a loss to the claimant.\n\nSee, e.g., Kerlinsky  v. Fidelity  &amp; Dep. Co.,  690 F.  Supp.\n                                             \n\n1112, 1120  (D. Mass. 1987).   In arguing that it  suffered a\n\nloss due to  delay, Alan Corp. focuses  almost exclusively on\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nthe  costs  of  meeting DEP's  clean-up  orders.4   We  note,\n\nmoreover, that regardless  of any delay by ISLIC,  Alan Corp.\n\nbore the initial liability for the clean-up costs assessed by\n\nDEP.  Moreover,  Alan Corp. has  not argued, nor could  it on\n\nthe  record before  us, that  ISLIC's alleged  delay had  any\n\neffect on the  cost of the  clean-up ordered  by DEP.   Thus,\n\neven  assuming that  there was  undue delay,  Alan  Corp. has\n\nfailed to offer proof that it was harmed by this delay.  \n\n          To the  extent  that Alan  Corp.  challenges  other\n\naspects  of  the district  court's ruling,  it  does so  in a\n\nperfunctory   manner,  without   any  attempt   at  developed\n\nargumentation.5  Such  arguments may be deemed  waived.  See,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., Romero  Lama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 481 n.12 (1st Cir.\n                            \n\n                    \n\n4.  In its brief, Alan Corp.  adverts in a perfunctory manner\nto  the fact that the  cost of remedial  work increased while\nISLIC delayed  its decision.   We have  often warned  parties\nthat issues raised in  a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\nsome effort at developed argumentation, may be deemed waived.\nSee,  e.g., FDIC  v. World Univ.  Inc., 978 F.2d  10, 15 (1st\n                                      \nCir.  1992).  Moreover, Alan Corp. made  no offer of proof to\nsupport this line of argument.\n\n5.  For example, Alan  Corp. argues without  elaboration that\nSection I.A., the \"property  damage\" provision of the policy,\napplies in this case.  It also argues that a policy extension\nwhich it purchased applies to lengthen the relevant reporting\nperiod.  The district court offered a thorough, well-reasoned\ndiscussion which  concluded:  1)  that Section I.A.  does not\napply  to the claims  at issue in  this case and  2) that the\nextension  purchased  by   Alan  Corp.  only   lengthens  the\nreporting period  for claims  under Section  I.A.   See  Alan\n                                                             \nCorp., 823 F.  Supp. at 40-41; see also, Wolf  Bros.

(hereinafter \"Alan Corp.\").  The district court found that the clean-up costs were not covered by the policy, and entered summary judgment in favor of ISLIC.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp. sells fuel oil to retail customers in central Massachusetts.  As part of its business, it stores oil in large tanks at several different locations.  On August 28, 1986, Alan Corp. obtained a pollution liability policy (\"the policy\") from ISLIC in order to insure against potential liability arising from storage tank leaks.  The policy covered two Alan Corp. storage sites located in the Massachusetts towns of Leominster and Fitchburg.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy was a one-year \"claims made\" policy,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in which ISLIC undertook, inter alia, to reimburse Alan Corp. for clean-up costs incurred as a result of government agency orders.  In relevant part, the policy stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>The company will reimburse the insured for reasonable and necessary clean-up costs incurred by the insured in the discharge of a legal obligation validly imposed through governmental action which is initiated during the policy period....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied).  The policy ran from August 28, 1986 to August 28, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about August 25, 1987, just prior to the expiration of the policy, Alan Corp. became aware of potential contamination at its Fitchburg and Leominster facilities.  In apparent partial compliance with state fire regulations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> David White, an Alan Corp. employee, phoned the Leominster Fire Department and notified it of the potential contamination at the Leominster site.  A Fire Department employee told White to determine what contamination, if any, existed and to report any such contamination to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering, now known as the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\").  No governmental agency was notified of the potential contamination of the Fitchburg site at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp. also submitted \"Loss Notice\" forms to ISLIC.  These forms, dated August 28, 1987, stated that a \"[p]reliminary survey shows a pollution problem\" at both the Leominster and Fitchburg sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp. alleges that on an unspecified date after the initial report to ISLIC of contamination at the Leominster and Fitchburg sites, an unidentified ISLIC employee told Alan Corp. to \"lay low\" with respect to those two sites until the clean-up of a third Alan Corp. storage site, located in Worcester, was completed.  (It appears that an entirely separate policy issued by ISLIC provided coverage for the Worcester site, that there was contamination at the Worcester site, and that during late August of 1987, ISLIC was involved with clean-up at the Worcester site).  That same unidentified employee allegedly assured Alan Corp. that ISLIC also would provide coverage for any necessary clean-up of the Leominster and Fitchburg sites upon completion of the Worcester site clean-up.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, ISLIC assigned an investigator to assess the contamination at the Leominster and Fitchburg sites.  Toward that same end, Alan Corp. hired Lycott Environmental Research Company, Inc.  (\"Lycott\") to investigate both sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About two months after these initial responses, the Lycott investigation revealed contamination at both sites.  On July 12, 1988, approximately eight months after the date of the Lycott report and nearly eleven months after the expiration of the policy, Alan Corp. reported the contamination of the Leominster site to DEP.  On January 11, 1989, nearly eighteen months after the expiration of the policy, DEP ordered the clean-up of the Leominster site.  On March 30, 1989, DEP issued a \"notice of responsibility\" to Alan Corp. for the Leominster site.  Thereafter, Alan Corp. conducted remedial efforts as required by DEP.  The record does not reveal when Alan Corp. notified DEP of the contamination at the Fitchburg site, but on August 13, 1991, DEP ordered clean-up at that site and Alan Corp. complied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing facts, Alan Corp. sought reimbursement from ISLIC for clean-up costs incurred at the Leominster and Fitchburg sites.  ISLIC denied coverage and Alan Corp. brought suit.  ISLIC moved for summary judgment, arguing that no governmental action had been initiated within the policy period, as required by the terms of the policy.  The district court granted summary judgment, reasoning that the call to the Leominster Fire Department, standing alone, did not amount to \"governmental action which is initiated during the policy period\" and that therefore coverage was not afforded under the policy.  See Alan Corp. v. International Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 823 F.Supp. 33 (D.Mass.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a district court's grant of summary judgment is plenary.  Bird v. Centennial Ins. Co., 11 F.3d 228, 231 (1st Cir.1993).  We read the record indulging all inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Levy v. FDIC, 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir.1993).  Summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, where, as here, the facts upon which liability is claimed or denied under an insurance policy are undisputed and the existence or amount of liability depends solely upon a construction of the policy, the question presented is one of law.  Atlas Pallet, Inc. v. Gallagher, 725 F.2d 131, 134 (1st Cir.1984).  As with other questions of law, we owe no deference to the district court's interpretation of the policy.  Id.  Finally, neither party disputes that Massachusetts law applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Call to the Fire Department</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp. argues that because its phone call to the Leominster Fire Department took place within the policy's claims period, the clean-up costs, which were incurred as a result of the order by DEP some twenty months after the expiration of the policy, were nonetheless \"validly imposed through governmental action which [was] initiated during the policy period.\"   In essence, Alan Corp. argues that the call to the Leominster Fire Department was the first of many steps that led to DEP's clean-up mandate, and that, because this first step was taken within the policy period, timely \"governmental action\" had therefore been \"initiated.\"   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that neither the phone call to the Leominster Fire Department nor any information conveyed during the phone call, imposed any obligation upon Alan Corp.  At best, David White was informed by the Leominster Fire Department that Alan Corp. had a duty to determine if contamination existed and that it had a duty to report any such contamination to DEP.  These duties existed entirely independently of the phone call.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 21E, Sec. 7 (stating that an owner of an oil storage site, \"as soon as he has knowledge of a release or threat of release of oil material, shall immediately notify [DEP] thereof\");  Mass.Regs.Code tit. 527, Sec. 9.19(1)(b) (1986) (stating that \"[i]n the event of a leak ... the owner or operator shall immediately notify the head of the local fire department and [DEP]\") (emphasis supplied).  Thus, even under the most generous reading of the policy, the Fire Department's recitation to David White of Alan Corp.'s duty to report contamination to DEP, without more, does not constitute the imposition of any legal obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was any further governmental action \"initiated\" through the phone call to the Leominster Fire Department.  The Fire Department made no record of the phone call;  it sent no representatives to the site;  it made no attempt to determine whether Alan Corp. had investigated the spill;  it made no attempt to determine whether Alan Corp. had reported any contamination to DEP;  and it never communicated with DEP, directly or otherwise, about the spill in any manner.  Rather, all clean-up costs in this case were imposed solely and independently by DEP, whose involvement, by Alan Corp.'s own admission, began well after the policy had expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the phone call to the Leominster Fire Department neither amounted to, nor did it \"initiate,\" governmental action for purposes of the policy.  Rather, all governmental action resulting in the imposition of clean-up costs was initiated by and through DEP.  Because DEP's actions were initiated well after the expiration date of the policy, Alan Corp. was afforded no coverage for its incurred clean-up costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Other Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, an unidentified ISLIC employee allegedly told Alan Corp. to \"lay low\" with regard to the contamination and went on to assure Alan Corp. that expenses for the clean-up of both the Leominster and Fitchburg sites would be covered by ISLIC.  Based on these statements, Alan Corp. argues that the doctrines of waiver and estoppel bar ISLIC from denying coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of insurance claims, waiver is the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right.  Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Nonaka, 414 Mass. 187, 606 N.E.2d 904, 906 (1993).  It is well established that, whatever the scope of waiver in insurance law, \"it does not extend to the broadening of coverage, so as to make the policy cover a risk not within its terms.\"  Palumbo v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 293 Mass. 35, 199 N.E. 335, 336 (1935).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy at issue here covers, inter alia, claims made against the insured which are initiated by governmental action during the policy period.  As pointed out above, the governmental action at issue here was initiated after the expiration of the policy.  In sum, the doctrine of waiver does not operate in this case to lengthen the period of the policy so as to include the clean-up costs assessed by DEP.  Accordingly, Alan Corp.'s waiver argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp.'s estoppel argument is equally unavailing.  Estoppel in the insurance context necessarily implies some reasonable, good-faith reliance by the insured upon some act, conduct or inaction of the insurer, to the detriment of the insured.  See, e.g., O'Blenes v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 397 Mass. 555, 492 N.E.2d 354, 356 (1986).  As a general matter, estoppel, like waiver, does not extend, broaden or enlarge coverage so as to include risks not covered within the terms of the policy.  Cf. Nieves v. Intercontinental Life Ins. Co., 964 F.2d 60, 66 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that, under Puerto Rico law, an insurance policy cannot be extended by waiver or estoppel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp. argues that it would have contacted DEP within the claims period (and thus, presumably, timely governmental action would have been initiated), but for ISLIC's advice to \"lay low.\"   Alan Corp.'s argument leaves us to conclude that it was aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of its statutory and regulatory obligation to report potential contamination to DEP.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 21E, Sec. 7;  Mass.Regs.Code tit. 527, Sec. 9.19(1)(b) (1986).  Moreover, according to Alan Corp.'s own evidence, the Leominster Fire Department instructed Alan Corp. to report contamination to DEP.  We agree with the district court that reliance upon an insurance company's advice not to report contamination, in the face of both a statutory and regulatory duty to report such contamination and advice from a local fire department to do so, can be neither reasonable nor in good faith.  In the absence of good faith or reasonable reliance, Alan Corp.'s estoppel argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Alan Corp. argues that ISLIC was unfairly dilatory in making its determination that it would not provide coverage and that this delay amounted to an unfair trade practice under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A Secs. 2, 11 and Mass.Gen.L. ch. 176D, Secs. 3(9)(a-f) and (n).  In order to make out a claim under these statutes, however, a claimant must establish both that an unfair trade practice occurred and that the unfair practice resulted in a loss to the claimant.  See, e.g., Kerlinsky v. Fidelity &amp; Dep.  Co., 690 F.Supp. 1112, 1120 (D.Mass.1987).  In arguing that it suffered a loss due to delay, Alan Corp. focuses almost exclusively on the costs of meeting DEP's clean-up orders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We note, moreover, that regardless of any delay by ISLIC, Alan Corp. bore the initial liability for the clean-up costs assessed by DEP.  Moreover, Alan Corp. has not argued, nor could it on the record before us, that ISLIC's alleged delay had any effect on the cost of the clean-up ordered by DEP.

(hereinafter \"Alan Corp.\").  The district court found that the clean-up costs were not covered by the policy, and entered summary judgment in favor of ISLIC.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp. sells fuel oil to retail customers in central Massachusetts.  As part of its business, it stores oil in large tanks at several different locations.  On August 28, 1986, Alan Corp. obtained a pollution liability policy (\"the policy\") from ISLIC in order to insure against potential liability arising from storage tank leaks.  The policy covered two Alan Corp. storage sites located in the Massachusetts towns of Leominster and Fitchburg.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy was a one-year \"claims made\" policy,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in which ISLIC undertook, inter alia, to reimburse Alan Corp. for clean-up costs incurred as a result of government agency orders.  In relevant part, the policy stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>The company will reimburse the insured for reasonable and necessary clean-up costs incurred by the insured in the discharge of a legal obligation validly imposed through governmental action which is initiated during the policy period....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied).  The policy ran from August 28, 1986 to August 28, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about August 25, 1987, just prior to the expiration of the policy, Alan Corp. became aware of potential contamination at its Fitchburg and Leominster facilities.  In apparent partial compliance with state fire regulations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> David White, an Alan Corp. employee, phoned the Leominster Fire Department and notified it of the potential contamination at the Leominster site.  A Fire Department employee told White to determine what contamination, if any, existed and to report any such contamination to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering, now known as the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\").  No governmental agency was notified of the potential contamination of the Fitchburg site at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp. also submitted \"Loss Notice\" forms to ISLIC.  These forms, dated August 28, 1987, stated that a \"[p]reliminary survey shows a pollution problem\" at both the Leominster and Fitchburg sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp. alleges that on an unspecified date after the initial report to ISLIC of contamination at the Leominster and Fitchburg sites, an unidentified ISLIC employee told Alan Corp. to \"lay low\" with respect to those two sites until the clean-up of a third Alan Corp. storage site, located in Worcester, was completed.  (It appears that an entirely separate policy issued by ISLIC provided coverage for the Worcester site, that there was contamination at the Worcester site, and that during late August of 1987, ISLIC was involved with clean-up at the Worcester site).  That same unidentified employee allegedly assured Alan Corp. that ISLIC also would provide coverage for any necessary clean-up of the Leominster and Fitchburg sites upon completion of the Worcester site clean-up.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, ISLIC assigned an investigator to assess the contamination at the Leominster and Fitchburg sites.  Toward that same end, Alan Corp. hired Lycott Environmental Research Company, Inc.  (\"Lycott\") to investigate both sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About two months after these initial responses, the Lycott investigation revealed contamination at both sites.  On July 12, 1988, approximately eight months after the date of the Lycott report and nearly eleven months after the expiration of the policy, Alan Corp. reported the contamination of the Leominster site to DEP.  On January 11, 1989, nearly eighteen months after the expiration of the policy, DEP ordered the clean-up of the Leominster site.  On March 30, 1989, DEP issued a \"notice of responsibility\" to Alan Corp. for the Leominster site.  Thereafter, Alan Corp. conducted remedial efforts as required by DEP.  The record does not reveal when Alan Corp. notified DEP of the contamination at the Fitchburg site, but on August 13, 1991, DEP ordered clean-up at that site and Alan Corp. complied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing facts, Alan Corp. sought reimbursement from ISLIC for clean-up costs incurred at the Leominster and Fitchburg sites.  ISLIC denied coverage and Alan Corp. brought suit.  ISLIC moved for summary judgment, arguing that no governmental action had been initiated within the policy period, as required by the terms of the policy.  The district court granted summary judgment, reasoning that the call to the Leominster Fire Department, standing alone, did not amount to \"governmental action which is initiated during the policy period\" and that therefore coverage was not afforded under the policy.

As with other questions of law, we owe no deference to the district court's interpretation of the policy.  Id.  Finally, neither party disputes that Massachusetts law applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Call to the Fire Department</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp. argues that because its phone call to the Leominster Fire Department took place within the policy's claims period, the clean-up costs, which were incurred as a result of the order by DEP some twenty months after the expiration of the policy, were nonetheless \"validly imposed through governmental action which [was] initiated during the policy period.\"   In essence, Alan Corp. argues that the call to the Leominster Fire Department was the first of many steps that led to DEP's clean-up mandate, and that, because this first step was taken within the policy period, timely \"governmental action\" had therefore been \"initiated.\"   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that neither the phone call to the Leominster Fire Department nor any information conveyed during the phone call, imposed any obligation upon Alan Corp.  At best, David White was informed by the Leominster Fire Department that Alan Corp. had a duty to determine if contamination existed and that it had a duty to report any such contamination to DEP.  These duties existed entirely independently of the phone call.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 21E, Sec. 7 (stating that an owner of an oil storage site, \"as soon as he has knowledge of a release or threat of release of oil material, shall immediately notify [DEP] thereof\");  Mass.Regs.Code tit. 527, Sec. 9.19(1)(b) (1986) (stating that \"[i]n the event of a leak ... the owner or operator shall immediately notify the head of the local fire department and [DEP]\") (emphasis supplied).  Thus, even under the most generous reading of the policy, the Fire Department's recitation to David White of Alan Corp.'s duty to report contamination to DEP, without more, does not constitute the imposition of any legal obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was any further governmental action \"initiated\" through the phone call to the Leominster Fire Department.  The Fire Department made no record of the phone call;  it sent no representatives to the site;  it made no attempt to determine whether Alan Corp. had investigated the spill;  it made no attempt to determine whether Alan Corp. had reported any contamination to DEP;  and it never communicated with DEP, directly or otherwise, about the spill in any manner.  Rather, all clean-up costs in this case were imposed solely and independently by DEP, whose involvement, by Alan Corp.'s own admission, began well after the policy had expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the phone call to the Leominster Fire Department neither amounted to, nor did it \"initiate,\" governmental action for purposes of the policy.  Rather, all governmental action resulting in the imposition of clean-up costs was initiated by and through DEP.  Because DEP's actions were initiated well after the expiration date of the policy, Alan Corp. was afforded no coverage for its incurred clean-up costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Other Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, an unidentified ISLIC employee allegedly told Alan Corp. to \"lay low\" with regard to the contamination and went on to assure Alan Corp. that expenses for the clean-up of both the Leominster and Fitchburg sites would be covered by ISLIC.  Based on these statements, Alan Corp. argues that the doctrines of waiver and estoppel bar ISLIC from denying coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of insurance claims, waiver is the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right.  Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Nonaka, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2036095\"><a href=\"/opinion/2036095/merrimack-mutual-fire-ins-co-v-nonaka/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2036095\"><a href=\"/opinion/2036095/merrimack-mutual-fire-ins-co-v-nonaka/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></a></span>, 906 (1993).  It is well established that, whatever the scope of waiver in insurance law, \"it does not extend to the broadening of coverage, so as to make the policy cover a risk not within its terms.\"  Palumbo v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span>, 336 (1935).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy at issue here covers, inter alia, claims made against the insured which are initiated by governmental action during the policy period.  As pointed out above, the governmental action at issue here was initiated after the expiration of the policy.  In sum, the doctrine of waiver does not operate in this case to lengthen the period of the policy so as to include the clean-up costs assessed by DEP.  Accordingly, Alan Corp.'s waiver argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp.'s estoppel argument is equally unavailing.  Estoppel in the insurance context necessarily implies some reasonable, good-faith reliance by the insured upon some act, conduct or inaction of the insurer, to the detriment of the insured.  See, e.g., O'Blenes v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2068087\"><a href=\"/opinion/2068087/oblenes-v-zoning-board-of-appeals-of-lynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2068087\"><a href=\"/opinion/2068087/oblenes-v-zoning-board-of-appeals-of-lynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span>, 356 (1986).  As a general matter, estoppel, like waiver, does not extend, broaden or enlarge coverage so as to include risks not covered within the terms of the policy.  Cf. Nieves v. Intercontinental Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583577\"><a href=\"/opinion/583577/rebecca-r-nieves-individually-and-as-next-friend-of-andrew-j-nieves-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that, under Puerto Rico law, an insurance policy cannot be extended by waiver or estoppel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alan Corp. argues that it would have contacted DEP within the claims period (and thus, presumably, timely governmental action would have been initiated), but for ISLIC's advice to \"lay low.\"   Alan Corp.'s argument leaves us to conclude that it was aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of its statutory and regulatory obligation to report potential contamination to DEP.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 21E, Sec. 7;  Mass.Regs.Code tit. 527, Sec. 9.19(1)(b) (1986).  Moreover, according to Alan Corp.'s own evidence, the Leominster Fire Department instructed Alan Corp. to report contamination to DEP.  We agree with the district court that reliance upon an insurance company's advice not to report contamination, in the face of both a statutory and regulatory duty to report such contamination and advice from a local fire department to do so, can be neither reasonable nor in good faith.  In the absence of good faith or reasonable reliance, Alan Corp.'s estoppel argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Alan Corp. argues that ISLIC was unfairly dilatory in making its determination that it would not provide coverage and that this delay amounted to an unfair trade practice under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A Secs. 2, 11 and Mass.Gen.L. ch. 176D, Secs. 3(9)(a-f) and (n).  In order to make out a claim under these statutes, however, a claimant must establish both that an unfair trade practice occurred and that the unfair practice resulted in a loss to the claimant.  See, e.g., Kerlinsky v. Fidelity &amp; Dep.  Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2358787\"><a href=\"/opinion/2358787/kerlinsky-v-fidelity-deposit-co-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1112</span></a></span>, 1120 (D.Mass.1987).  In arguing that it suffered a loss due to delay, Alan Corp. focuses almost exclusively on the costs of meeting DEP's clean-up orders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We note, moreover, that regardless of any delay by ISLIC, Alan Corp. bore the initial liability for the clean-up costs assessed by DEP.  Moreover, Alan Corp. has not argued, nor could it on the record before us, that ISLIC's alleged delay had any effect on the cost of the clean-up ordered by DEP.  Thus, even assuming that there was undue delay, Alan Corp. has failed to offer proof that it was harmed by this delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Alan Corp. challenges other aspects of the district court's ruling, it does so in a perfunctory manner, without any attempt at developed argumentation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Such arguments may be deemed waived.

Thus, \" 'a doctor who practiced for only one year, say 1972, would need only one 1972 \"occurrence\" policy to be fully covered, but he would need several years of \"claims made\" policies to protect himself from claims arising out of his acts in 1972.' \"  Id.

He did not specify any individual at ISLIC who may have made the comments, nor did he specify any individual at Alan Corp. who may have heard them, nor any time or date when the comments may have been made.

We have often warned parties that issues raised in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, may be deemed waived.  See, e.g., FDIC v. World Univ.  Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593291\"><a href=\"/opinion/593291/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-world-university-inc-santa/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1992).

It also argues that a policy extension which it purchased applies to lengthen the relevant reporting period.  The district court offered a thorough, well-reasoned discussion which concluded:  1) that Section I.A. does not apply to the claims at issue in this case and 2) that the extension purchased by Alan Corp. only lengthens the reporting period for claims under Section I.A.
