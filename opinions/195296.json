Plaintiff William Ferguson appeals a\n                    \n\ndistrict court judgment which  dismissed his pro se complaint\n                                                   \n\nfor  failure  to  state a  claim  upon  which  relief can  be\n\ngranted.    Having thoroughly  reviewed  the  record and  the\n\nplaintiff's briefs  and reply  briefs, we are  persuaded that\n\nthe  district  court  judgment  is correct.    Moreover,  the\n\nplaintiff's multiple  filings demonstrate  that this  suit is\n\npatently frivolous  and thus also subject  to dismissal under\n\n28 U.S.C.  1915(d).   See Neitzke v. Williams, 490  U.S. 319,\n                                             \n\n327-28  (1990).1   Accordingly,  the defendants'  motion  for\n\nsummary  affirmance  is  allowed  and  the  judgment  of  the\n                                \n\ndistrict court is affirmed.2       \n                          \n\n                    \n\n1.  Thus, there  also was  no error  in the  district court's\ndenial of Ferguson's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\n2.  Ferguson's  motion  to  adduce  additional   evidence  is\ndenied.\n\n                             -2-\n",
