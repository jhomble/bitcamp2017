The National Labor Relations Board (\"the\n\nNLRB\") petitions for enforcement of an order it issued on April 30,\n\n2008 against respondent, Metro Mayagüez, Inc. (\"Metro Mayagüez\").\n\nThe NLRB's order found that Metro Mayagüez violated the National\n\nLabor   Relations    Act   (\"the   NLRA\"),    29   U.S.C.   §§   151-169,     by\n\ncommitting unfair labor practices.\n\n             In December 2007, the five-member NLRB, pursuant to\n\nsection 3(b) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. § 153(b), delegated its powers\n\nto a three-member group. When the NLRB issued the underlying order\n\nin the instant case, the NLRB had only two members.                While this\n\nappeal was pending, the Supreme Court held in New Process Steel,\n\nL.P. v. NLRB, No. 08-1457, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 4973, at *5 (June 17,\n\n2010), that, following a delegation of the NLRB's powers to a\n\nthree-member group, two members cannot continue to exercise that\n\ndelegated authority once the group's (and the NLRB's) membership\n\nfalls   to   two.1    Accordingly,    we     conclude   that     the   NLRB   as\n\nconstituted did not have the authority to issue the April 30, 2008\n\norder against Metro Mayagüez. We thus deny the NLRB's petition for\n\nenforcement.\n\n\n\n1\n   See, e.g., Fola Coal Co. v. NLRB, No. 09-1938, 2010 U.S. App.\nLEXIS 13658, at *2 (4th Cir.
