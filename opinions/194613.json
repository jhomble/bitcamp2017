We have carefully reviewed the record\n                    \n\nand briefs and  find no merit  substantially for the  reasons\n\nstated  by  the district  court.   We pause  to add  only two\n\nobservations.\n\n          1.    The prosecutor's  reference  to  Ms. Aguiar's\n\nrecent trial, immediately followed by the inquiry whether Ms.\n\nAguiar  had ever told anyone her present version, was, in all\n\nprobability, an  improper  comment  on  Aguiar's  failure  to\n\ntestify1.   We are convinced, however, by the strength of the\n\nevidence   against  defendant   and   the  court's   curative\n\ninstruction that  the error was harmless  beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, and  the  court did  not  err in  denying  defendant's\n\nmotion for a mistrial.\n\n          2.   The fact that Aguiar had been convicted of the\n\ncharges  for  which  defendant  was  on  trial  was  properly\n\nadmissible under  Fed. R. Evid.  609 for impeachment.   Here,\n\nwhere defendant said he had no objection to the  conviction's\n\nadmission, defendant did not object  to the question asked or\n\nrequest a limiting  instruction, and the  prosecutor did  not\n\nargue  any improper  inference should  be drawn,  it  was not\n\nplain error  for the  court  to fail  sua  sponte to  give  a\n                                                 \n\nlimiting  instruction.
