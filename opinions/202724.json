O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                    Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Singal,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rosemary Curran Scapicchio for appellant.\n     Randall E. Ravitz, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nThomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 30, 2007\n\n\n___________________\n\n     * Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.\n\f           LIPEZ,   Circuit    Judge.   This   case,   involving   the\n\nexhaustion requirement for habeas petitioners, requires us to\n\nexamine some particulars of Massachusetts appellate procedure.\n\nAlthough we note the possibility that a portion of one of our prior\n\ndecisions,   Barresi v. Maloney, 296 F.3d 48 (1st Cir. 2002), might\n\nno longer be valid in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nBaldwin v. Reese, 541 U.S. 27 (2004), we need not decide that\n\nquestion here. We conclude that the habeas petitioner in this case\n\nsucceeded in exhausting one claim, which the district court found\n\nunexhausted, because of the then-existing Massachusetts Rules of\n\nAppellate Procedure. We also find, however, that another claim was\n\nproperly deemed unexhausted by the district court because the state\n\nrules do not reach as far as the petitioner has suggested.          We\n\ntherefore affirm in part, reverse in part and remand as to one\n\nclaim.\n\n                                   I.\n\nA.   State Court Proceedings\n\n           Because the specific facts of the crime underlying this\n\ncase are not particularly relevant, we recount them only briefly,\n\nwith the rebuttable presumption that factual findings by the state\n\ncourts are correct.   See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).      A more complete\n\nrecitation of the facts can be found in the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court's (\"SJC\") opinion, Commonwealth v. Clements, 763\n\nN.E.2d 55 (Mass. 2002).\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f              Clements was convicted of murdering Gregory Tillery in\n\n1995.       Tillery was shot on a street corner by a man wearing a\n\nhooded sweatshirt. An eyewitness identified Clements as the killer\n\nwhile testifying before the grand jury, but recanted that testimony\n\nat   trial.      The   remainder   of    the   evidence   presented   by   the\n\ngovernment was circumstantial.          Clements was convicted on charges\n\nof murder in the second degree by joint venture, armed assault with\n\nintent to murder, and unlicensed possession of a gun.                  A co-\n\ndefendant was acquitted.\n\n              Clements was given a life sentence, and he immediately\n\nappealed his convictions.      His motion for a new trial was denied,\n\nand he appealed that decision as well. Clements made nine separate\n\nlegal arguments to the Appeals Court, but his conviction was\n\naffirmed.1     Thereafter, he filed an Application for Leave to Obtain\n\nFurther Appellate Review (ALOFAR) with the SJC, raising only three\n\nlegal claims.2\n\n\n      1\n       The nine legal claims presented to the Appeals Court were\ndescribed in some detail by the district court. See Clements v.\nMaloney, 359 F. Supp. 2d 2, 5 (D. Mass. 2005).       They are also\nsummarized, of course, in the decision issued by the Appeals Court.\nSee Commonwealth v. Clements, 747 N.E.2d 682, 685 (Mass. App. Ct.\n2001).\n        2\n        Those claims appeared in the ALOFAR as follows:\n      (A) Whether the Appeals Court's decision holding that\n      inconsistent, recanted extrajudicial statements of\n      identification constituting the sole evidence of guilt is\n      sufficient to convict pursuant to Commonwealth v. Daye,\n      393 Mass. 55 (1984)? [the \"sufficiency claim\"]\n      (B) Whether the jury's special verdict, finding the\n      defendant guilty as a joint venturer but not as the\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            The SJC granted further appellate review, limited to the\n\nsufficiency claim, and affirmed the conviction.         The SJC held that\n\nthe recanted testimony was not the sole evidence of guilt, as\n\nClements claimed, and that there was sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe verdict.   Clements' argument in support of this claim, both in\n\nhis   ALOFAR   and   his   supplemental   brief   to    the   SJC,   relied\n\nexclusively on state law.\n\nB.    Federal Court Proceedings\n\n            After the SJC rejected his direct appeal, Clements filed\n\nthis habeas petition in the district court raising six legal\n\nclaims.    Three of them were the ones included in the ALOFAR.         Two\n\nof the other three had been argued to the state Appeals Court.          One\n\nhad not previously been raised in any court.           In response to the\n\nstate's motion to dismiss, Clements argued that he had fully\n\nexhausted his state remedies on all six claims and that, if some\n\nclaims were found unexhausted, he should be granted a stay in\n\nfederal court so that he could return to state court to exhaust his\n\nremaining claims without fear of exceeding AEDPA's one-year statute\n\n\n      princip[al] of the crime of second degree murder was\n      supported by sufficient evidence to convict? [the \"joint\n      venture claim\"]\n      (C) Whether the Appeals Court failed to address Clements'\n      claim that instructions to deliberating jurors to ignore\n      the opinion of the lone holdout invaded the province of\n      the jury and violated Clements' right to a fair trial\n      pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n      United States Constitution as well as Article XII of the\n      Massachusetts Declaration of Rights? [the \"jury hold-out\n      claim\"]\n\n                                   -4-\n\fof limitations.   The district court carefully reviewed the claims\n\nClements raised in his habeas petition, looking first at the claims\n\nthat had been included in his ALOFAR and then at the claims\n\nexcluded therefrom, and concluded that only the jury hold-out claim\n\nwas exhausted because it was the only one \"fairly presented by the\n\npetitioner for review as a federal claim.\"3\n\n          More    specifically,   the   court   found   that   both   the\n\nsufficiency and the joint venture claims were presented to the SJC\n\nsolely as state law claims and that they therefore had not been\n\nexhausted.   As to both of these claims, the district court stated\n\nthat no federal cases were cited and the ALOFAR did not articulate\n\nany federal issues in a recognizable way.\n\n          With respect to the claims raised in the habeas petition\n\nthat had not appeared in the ALOFAR, the court found that three of\n\nthese claims were presented to the Appeals Court as state law\n\nclaims, while two were originally argued in reliance on both state\n\nand federal law.      One claim appeared in the habeas petition,\n\ndespite not being raised before either the Appeals Court or SJC.4\n\n\n     3\n       The habeas petition combined the jury hold-out claim with\nanother related issue, which had not been included in the ALOFAR,\nas part of a single \"claim.\" Thus, one of the six habeas claims\ncomprises two separate arguments, one of which was found exhausted\nby the district court (the hold-out claim) and one of which was not\n(a claim that the trial court should have ordered a mistrial after\nthe jury twice announced it was deadlocked). The exhaustion of the\njury hold-out claim is not disputed in this appeal.\n     4\n      The district court broke some of the habeas claims down into\nsub-claims; while the habeas petition listed six grounds for\n\n                                  -5-\n\fClements argued that all of these claims had some basis in federal\n\nlaw, and that they ought to be found exhausted because a review of\n\nthe brief filed with the Appeals Court revealed those federal\n\nbases.     The district court found Clements' arguments meritless\n\nbecause the Supreme Court's decision in Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U.S.\n\n27, 32 (2004), held that a claim cannot be exhausted if it is not\n\npresented directly to the state's highest court.\n\n            Finally, the district court rejected Clements' request\n\nfor a stay of his habeas petition because the failure to exhaust\n\nwas a result of \"deliberate,\" \"tactical\" decisions by Clements'\n\ncounsel.   The court noted our decision in Neverson v. Bissonnette,\n\n261 F.3d 120, 126 n.3 (1st Cir. 2001), which endorsed granting\n\nstays in certain cases, but concluded that this case did not merit\n\na stay. The district court issued a provisional decision, allowing\n\nClements to decide whether to proceed in federal court on his\n\nsingle   exhausted   claim   (by   voluntarily   dismissing   the   other,\n\nunexhausted claims) or to dismiss his whole petition and return to\n\nstate court.\n\n            Clements requested additional time to respond to the\n\ndistrict court's provisional order, citing the Supreme Court's\n\nthen-recent decision regarding \"mixed\" habeas petitions, Rhines v.\n\n\n\n\nrelief, the district court analyzed ten distinct claims.               See\nClements, 359 F. Supp. 2d at 5-11; see e.g., supra note 3.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fWeber, 544 U.S. 269 (2005).5        The request was granted and Clements\n\nsubsequently      informed   the    district      court   that   he    would    not\n\nvoluntarily dismiss any of his habeas claims (in order to proceed\n\nwith the exhausted claim), and that he \"fe[lt] strongly that the\n\nSupreme Court's decision [in] Rhines v. Weber supports his request\n\nfor   a   [s]tay.\"    The    district     court    then   dismissed     Clements'\n\npetition pursuant to its earlier provisional order.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            The   requirement      that   habeas    petitioners       exhaust   all\n\navailable state remedies was originally imposed by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518 (1982).                 Subsequently,\n\nCongress codified the requirement as part of the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective    Death   Penalty    Act   of    1996    (\"AEDPA\"),    28    U.S.C.    §\n\n2254(b)(1)(A), and also added a one year statute of limitations for\n\nthe filing of habeas petitions, id. § 2244(d).              Regardless of its\n\nsource, the exhaustion requirement has long served to infuse into\n\nour habeas jurisprudence the interests of comity and federalism.\n\nSee, e.g., Rose, 455 U.S. at 518-19 (finding that \"'it would be\n\nunseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district\n\ncourt to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to\n\nthe state courts to correct a constitutional violation,'\" and that\n\n\n      5\n      \"Mixed\" habeas petitions are those containing both exhausted\nand unexhausted claims. Rhines held that, where certain criteria\nare satisfied, such petitions should be stayed in federal court so\nthat the petitioner can return to state court to complete the\nexhaustion process. 544 U.S. at 278.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f\"[a] rigorously enforced total exhaustion rule will encourage state\n\nprisoners to seek full relief first from the state courts, thus\n\ngiving those courts the first opportunity to review all claims of\n\nconstitutional error\") (quoting Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204\n\n(1950)).\n\n            In order to exhaust a claim, the petitioner must \"present\n\nthe federal claim fairly and recognizably\" to the state courts,\n\nmeaning that he \"must show that he tendered his federal claim 'in\n\nsuch a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would\n\nhave been alerted to the existence of the federal question.'\"\n\nCasella v. Clemons, 207 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting\n\nAdelson v. DiPaola, 131 F.3d 259, 262 (1st Cir. 1997)).       This means\n\nthat \"the legal theory [articulated] in the state and federal\n\ncourts must be the same.\"      Gagne v. Fair, 835 F.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).     This standard must be met, as a general rule, by \"fairly\n\npresent[ing]\" a federal claim \"within the four corners of the\n\nALOFAR.\"    Mele v. Fitchburg Dist. Ct., 850 F.2d 817, 823 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).     We have previously held that a habeas petitioner may\n\naccomplish this by doing any of the following: (1) citing a\n\nprovision of the federal constitution; (2) presenting a federal\n\nconstitutional claim in a manner that fairly alerts the state court\n\nto   the    federal   nature   of   the   claim;   (3)   citing   federal\n\nconstitutional precedents; or (4) claiming violation of a right\n\nspecifically protected in the federal constitution.           Gagne, 835\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fF.2d at 7.    We have also noted that, in some situations, citations\n\nto state court decisions which rely on federal law or articulation\n\nof   a   state      claim    that    is,    \"as    a    practical     matter,    []\n\nindistinguishable from one arising under federal law,\" may suffice\n\nto satisfy the exhaustion requirement.             Nadworny v. Fair, 872 F.2d\n\n1093,    1099-1100    (1st    Cir.    1989).       It    is,     however,   clearly\n\ninadequate to simply recite the facts underlying a state claim,\n\nwhere those facts might support either a federal or state claim.\n\nMartens v. Shannon, 836 F.2d 715, 717 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n             Clements contends that all six of his habeas claims have\n\nsatisfied     the    exhaustion      requirement       because    they   were   all\n\npresented to the Appeals Court with some citation or reference to\n\nfederal cases.      He explains that our precedent, Barresi v. Maloney\n\n296 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir. 2002), permitting us to review certain\n\n\"backdrop\"     materials      in     some     cases,     in    combination      with\n\nMassachusetts' procedural rules, effectively renders his brief to\n\nthe Appeals Court \"presented\" to the SJC, meaning that all the\n\narguments he made before the Appeals Court were made to the SJC.\n\nThe government responds by arguing that our decision in Barresi has\n\nbeen invalidated by the Supreme Court's more recent decision in\n\nBaldwin v. Reese, 541 U.S. 27 (2004).\n\n             We begin with the two claims that were presented in the\n\nALOFAR, which the district court found to be unexhausted: first the\n\njoint venture claim and then the sufficiency claim.                         We will\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fbriefly comment on the government's argument about the continued\n\nvitality of our Barresi decision in the context of the joint\n\nventure claim.       We then turn to the claims that were omitted\n\nentirely from the ALOFAR.           Our review of the district court's\n\ndecision regarding exhaustion is de novo.          Goodrich v. Hall, 448\n\nF.3d 45, 47 (1st Cir. 2006); Barresi, 296 F.3d at 51.\n\nA.   Joint Venture Claim\n\n           One of Clements' three ALOFAR claims — the joint venture\n\nclaim — was presented to the SJC solely in terms of state law.           The\n\nportion of Clements' ALOFAR discussing this claim relied on no\n\nfederal cases and did not label the claim as federal.            It also made\n\nno arguments using vague (and possibly federal law based) phrases,\n\nsuch as \"due process.\"       Clements argues, nonetheless, that this\n\nclaim was exhausted because, under Barresi, 296 F.3d at 52, the\n\nexhaustion      analysis   should    include   a   review   of    \"backdrop\"\n\nmaterials, such as the Appeals Court brief, wherein he says that\n\nthe federal nature of his claim was made clear.                  In order to\n\nevaluate this claim, we must determine whether Barresi applies to\n\na claim styled like Clements' joint venture claim.\n\n           1.    Barresi v. Maloney\n\n           In Barresi, we held that, where a claim has not been\n\nabandoned before the state's highest court, the exhaustion analysis\n\nincludes an examination of the \"'backdrop against which [] later\n\nfilings [must] be viewed,'\" 296 F.3d at 52 (second alteration in\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\foriginal) (quoting Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1994)),\n\nand       that     backdrop     includes   \"the   pleadings   and   filings\n\nsubmitted . . . to lower state courts,\"                id.6   Barresi also\n\nrecognized the continued validity of the \"four corners rule,\" see\n\nMele, 850 F.2d at 821-23, and held that the \"backdrop\" materials\n\ncould only be consulted \"under certain circumstances.\" 296 F.3d at\n\n52.\n\n                 At that time, we did not specify what those limited\n\ncircumstances might be.          However, in Barresi itself, the ALOFAR at\n\nissue included claims regarding the right to confront adverse\n\nwitnesses and due process, both of which are claims that may be\n\ngrounded either in state law or federal law or both, and cited\n\nstate court cases that relied upon federal law.               Id. at 53-54.\n\nTherefore, we found that Barresi's ALOFAR minimally satisfied the\n\nexhaustion requirement.            As part of the explanation for that\n\nconclusion, we noted that the same claims had been raised in the\n\nintermediate appellate brief, where Barresi had directly cited\n\nfederal precedents.           Id. at 55-56.\n\n                 We have subsequently said that the Barresi backdrop rule\n\napplies only in cases where the ALOFAR (or other petition to a\n\nstate supreme court) was ambiguous about the federal nature of a\n\n\n      6\n       Although Barresi did not explicitly define or explain the\nterm \"abandoned,\" that term has been interpreted to mean that a\nclaim was omitted entirely, meaning not argued on either state or\nfederal grounds, from the ALOFAR (or similar petition to a state's\nhighest court).\n\n                                       -11-\n\fclaim, as it was in Barresi.       See Josselyn v. Dennehy, 475 F.3d 1,\n\n3-4 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting that Barresi's \"backdrop\" principle\n\napplies when there is ambiguity in the ALOFAR regarding the federal\n\nnature of the claim); Goodrich, 448 F.3d at 48 (reviewing the\n\npetitioner's lower court briefs as part of the exhaustion analysis,\n\nbecause   the   ALOFAR   relied    primarily    on   state   cases,   but   was\n\nsomewhat ambiguous about the source of the legal claim).\n\n           Because   this   case    involves    an   ALOFAR   that    was   not\n\nambiguous, the Barresi \"backdrop\" principle, assuming it is still\n\nvalid, provides no assistance to Clements.           We add that qualifier\n\nabout the continuing validity of the \"backdrop\" principle because\n\nof the Supreme Court's decision in Baldwin v. Reese.\n\n           In Baldwin, 541 U.S. at 32, the Court held that, where a\n\nfederal claim was not included in a petition, the exhaustion\n\nanalysis could not encompass materials beyond the petition or brief\n\nfiled with the state's highest court.          In that case, the defendant\n\nhad filed a petition seeking discretionary appellate review by the\n\nOregon Supreme Court and had argued some claims based on federal\n\nlaw and other claims based only on state law.           The defendant later\n\nfiled a habeas petition and argued that at least one of the claims\n\nwhich was presented on state law grounds could be deemed exhausted\n\nbecause a review of the intermediate appellate court opinion showed\n\nthat he had made federal law arguments on that claim below.\n\nPursuant to Oregon's procedural rules, Oregon's Supreme Court\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fjustices had access to the lower court opinions in cases for which\n\na petition was filed, but their rules did not require them to\n\nreview such opinions.      Id. at 31.       Rather, the rules required a\n\nparty seeking review to assert all claims in the appellate brief.\n\n           At the outset of its analysis, the Supreme Court noted\n\nits assumption that the defendant's \"petition by itself did not\n\nproperly alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of\"\n\nthe claim.   Id. at 30.7    The Court then reasoned that, in such a\n\ncontext, permitting the exhaustion inquiry to include a review of\n\nthe lower court opinion simply because the state court judges had\n\nan \"opportunity\" to review it would effectively mean \"that those\n\njudges must read the lower court opinions — for otherwise they\n\nwould forfeit the State's opportunity to decide that federal claim\n\nin the first instance.\"     Id. at 31.      The Supreme Court found that\n\nburden   incompatible   with   the    \"considerations   of   federal-state\n\ncomity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.\"          Id. at\n\n\n\n     7\n       Although the Supreme Court clearly assumed that Baldwin's\npetition did not itself notify the state court that a federal claim\nwas intended, the petition in that case was not entirely clear.\nThe disputed claim involved the ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel and relied only on state law. However, the petition raised\na parallel claim regarding the ineffective assistance of the\ndefendant's trial counsel, and did make federal law arguments for\nthat claim. 541 U.S. at 30. Therefore, the petition in Baldwin\nwas, in a certain sense, ambiguous, much like the ALOFAR in\nBarresi, because a reasonable jurist might have concluded that the\ndefendant intended to make state and federal arguments as to both\nclaims, given that they were based on the same legal principle, and\nthat he simply failed to explicitly articulate federal law grounds\nfor the claim concerning appellate counsel.\n\n                                     -13-\n\f32.   Therefore, the Court held that \"ordinarily a state prisoner\n\ndoes not 'fairly present' a claim to a state court if that court\n\nmust read beyond a petition or a brief . . . that does not alert it\n\nto the presence of a federal claim in order to find material . . .\n\nthat does so.\" Id.\n\n           The Barresi approach to the exhaustion analysis may be\n\nincompatible with Baldwin.       Barresi permits us to consider lower\n\ncourt pleadings or opinions where the state court did not (and was\n\nnot required to) consider them itself.              However, as we have\n\nexplained, we subsequently limited the Barresi backdrop principle\n\nto cases in which there is an ambiguity in the ALOFAR about the\n\nfederal    nature   of   the   claim.     Whether    Baldwin   forecloses\n\nconsideration of backdrop materials even in cases of ambiguous\n\npetitions is a question we need not decide here because Clements'\n\njoint venture claim is unmistakably couched only in state law\n\nterms.    We therefore reserve the issue of the continuing validity\n\nof Barresi's backdrop principle for a case in which it is directly\n\nraised.\n\n           2.   Massachusetts' Procedural Rules\n\n           Clements offers an alternative to his Barresi argument in\n\nsupport of his claim that he fairly presented his joint venture\n\nclaim to the SJC. He argues that Massachusetts Rule of Appellate\n\nProcedure (\"MRAP\") 27.1 permits him to rely on the brief that he\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\ffiled with the Massachusetts Appeals Court to demonstrate the\n\nexhaustion of his claim.\n\n           MRAP Rule 27.1 says that the full Appeals Court record\n\nshould be transferred to the SJC after further appellate review is\n\ngranted.   At the time of Clements' appeal, the rule also stated\n\nthat the SJC appeal would be conducted on the basis of the Appeals\n\nCourt briefs.8 See infra note 11 (explaining subsequent alteration\n\nof this rule).    Clements contends that after further appellate\n\nreview is granted (regardless of whether it is a limited or general\n\ngrant9), the entire Appeals Court brief is properly \"before\" the\n\n\n     8\n       Massachusetts Rule of Appellate Procedure 27.1 reads in\npart:\n     Within twenty days after the date of the rescript of the\n     Appeals Court any party to the appeal may file an\n     application for leave to obtain further appellate review\n     of the case by the full Supreme Judicial Court. . . . A\n     copy of the rescript and opinion, if any, of the Appeals\n     Court shall be appended to the application. . . . If any\n     three justices of the Supreme Judicial Court shall vote\n     for further appellate review . . . an order allowing the\n     application or the certificate, as the case may be, shall\n     be transmitted to the clerk of the Appeals Court . . . .\n     The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the clerk of the\n     full Supreme Judicial Court all papers theretofore filed\n     in the case and shall notify the clerk of the lower court\n     that leave to obtain further appellate review has been\n     granted.\nMass. R. of App. P. 27.1 (a), (b), (e).\n     The Reporter's Notes at the time Clements' appeal was filed\nalso indicated that, after further appellate review is granted,\n\"the case will be reviewed in the Supreme Judicial Court based on\nthe brief that was earlier filed in the Appeals Court.\" Id. at\nReporter's Notes to Appellate Rule 27.1(f) — 2001.\n     9\n       The SJC has the authority to respond to an ALOFAR in any of\nthree ways. It may reject an ALOFAR outright, thereby affirming\nthe Appeals Court decision without further argument or explanation.\n\n                               -15-\n\fSJC, in the same way that the arguments contained in the ALOFAR\n\nwere before the SJC.      He contends that MRAP 27.1 has the effect,\n\ntherefore, of rendering all the arguments he presented to the lower\n\ncourt exhausted because the SJC was in possession of the full\n\nAppeals Court record, including his Appeals Court brief.             Citing\n\nthis \"possession,\" and the provision regarding reliance on the\n\nAppeals Court brief, Clements claims that the SJC is actually\n\nrequired    by   state   rules   to   review   the   lower   court   papers.\n\nConsequently, he argues, his Appeals Court brief should be treated\n\nas a part of the SJC's evaluation of his claim, just as the ALOFAR\n\nis so treated, and not as additional or independent backdrop\n\nmaterial.\n\n            Clements' argument mis-understands the significance of a\n\nlimited grant of further appellate review.           Clements relies on the\n\nprovision which allows an appeal, after further review has been\n\ngranted, to be argued on the basis of the Appeals Court brief for\n\nhis contention that the entire brief (not just the portion relevant\n\nto a limited grant) must be reviewed by the SJC.             See Mele, 850\n\nF.2d at 822 (noting that MRAP 27.1 requires the lower court record\n\n\n\nIt may also grant an ALOFAR, thereby exercising its discretionary\njurisdiction over the appeal and agreeing to consider all of the\nlegal questions raised in that appeal. Or, the SJC may issue a\nlimited grant in response to an ALOFAR, meaning that it has agreed\nto consider a single discrete issue (or multiple issues, but fewer\nthan all) on appeal. See infra note 10. In this case, the SJC\nchose the last of these options, and thus reviewed only one of the\nthree issues presented to it in Clements' ALOFAR.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fto be forwarded to the SJC \"only if — and after — it grants an\n\nALOFAR\").      As we have noted, the SJC in this case granted further\n\nreview    on    only   one   issue   (the   sufficiency   claim).   Under\n\nMassachusetts rules, when the SJC issues a limited grant, it does\n\nnot decide any issues beyond the one (or ones) granted review.10\n\nFor this reason, the formal transfer of the Appeals Court record to\n\nthe SJC does not require the SJC to review briefing or other\n\nmaterials relating to issues beyond the one(s) for which review was\n\ngranted.       Here, the SJC's receipt of the lower court record,\n\nincluding the Appeals Court brief, is relevant only to the one\n\nissue (sufficiency of the evidence) on which it exercised its\n\nappellate jurisdiction. On the issues for which review was denied,\n\nsuch as the joint venture claim, the physical transfer of the\n\nrecord and the use of the Appeals Court brief for argument on the\n\nsufficiency claim are irrelevant to the exhaustion inquiry.\n\n            We find further support for this conclusion in the\n\ngeneral principles articulated in Baldwin, 541 U.S. at 31-32.\n\nClements' interpretation of MRAP 27.1 would effectively require the\n\nSJC to read and evaluate all of the arguments presented to the\n\n\n     10\n       By contrast, if the SJC issues a general grant of further\nappellate review, it may review any issue in the case, regardless\nof whether the appellant specifically raised it in the ALOFAR. In\nother words, a general grant renders the entire Appeals Court\nrecord subject to the SJC's jurisdiction, while a limited grant\nplaces only discrete issues within the SJC's jurisdiction. See\nBradford v. Baystate Med. Ctr., 613 N.E.2d 82, 85 (Mass. 1993). We\ndo not address here the contours of an exhaustion analysis in the\ncontext of a general grant of further appellate review.\n\n                                     -17-\n\flower court after even a limited grant of further review, which is\n\nprecisely what Baldwin sought to preclude.                  In claiming that a\n\nlimited grant of further review places the full record (including\n\nboth the trial court and appeals court proceedings) before the SJC,\n\nand that the exhaustion analysis should encompass that full record,\n\nClements invites the federal habeas court to ignore the state's\n\nprocedural rules.         However, disregarding the difference between a\n\nlimited   grant     and    a   general    grant    would    contravene   Baldwin.\n\nBaldwin clearly limits the exhaustion analysis to the materials\n\nthat a state's highest court reviewed while deciding whether to\n\ngrant a discretionary appeal or evaluating such an appeal on its\n\nmerits.    Id. at 32.      Materials that are merely accessible to that\n\ncourt are not to be reviewed in an exhaustion inquiry.\n\n            Under MRAP 27.1, the portion of the Appeals Court brief\n\nrelating to the joint venture claim was not before the SJC when it\n\nreviewed Clements' appeal on the merits.                Therefore, our review of\n\nthe district court's finding that the joint venture claim was not\n\nexhausted must be based solely on the contents of the ALOFAR.\n\n            3.     Exhaustion of the Joint Venture Claim\n\n            Clements has not sought to persuade us that his ALOFAR\n\ndescribed, or even hinted at, a federal basis for his joint venture\n\nclaim.    The ALOFAR's discussion of this claim refers only to state\n\nlaw, and none of the cited state cases relied on federal law.                 The\n\nfederal    basis    for    the   claim    was     not   presented   \"fairly   and\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\frecognizably,\" Casella, 207 F.3d at 20, nor did Clements articulate\n\na federal law argument \"in such a way as to make it probable that\n\na reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the\n\nfederal question,\" Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 6.    Without any references,\n\nexplicit or implicit, to federal law or principles, the ALOFAR's\n\npresentation of the joint venture claim did not apprise the SJC of\n\na possible federal error in the state court's decision. Therefore,\n\nwe agree with the district court's conclusion that the joint\n\nventure claim was not exhausted.\n\nB.   The Sufficiency Claim\n\n           Unlike the joint venture claim, the SJC granted Clements\n\nfurther appellate review for his sufficiency claim. This important\n\nfact distinguishes our analysis of this claim from all other claims\n\nin this case, as well as the claims discussed in recent cases such\n\nas Goodrich, 448 F.3d at 47, and Josselyn, 475 F.3d at 3-4 (where\n\nthe claims at issue were not even mentioned in the ALOFAR and were\n\ndeemed abandoned when the ALOFAR was filed with the SJC).       The\n\ngrant of further appellate review is significant, as we have\n\nexplained, because of the procedural rules in Massachusetts.\n\n           Prior to a 2001 amendment, MRAP 27.1(f) stated that after\n\nfurther appellate review is granted, a party may elect to proceed\n\nwith the appeal before the SJC on the basis of the Appeals Court\n\nbrief previously filed or may petition for permission to submit a\n\nnew (\"separate or supplemental\") brief.      See Mass. R. App. P.\n\n\n                                -19-\n\fReporter's Notes -- 2001.          Clements requested, and was granted,\n\npermission to file a new brief.         At the time of Clements' appeal,\n\nthe Massachusetts Rules did not expressly indicate whether the new\n\nbrief would be considered exclusively or alongside the Appeals\n\nCourt brief.       Because the Rules said that a new brief may be\n\nsupplemental, we assume here that the SJC reviewed both the Appeals\n\nCourt     brief   (on   the   sufficiency   issue   only)   and   the   new   or\n\nsupplemental      brief.11     Therefore,   we   examine    the   ALOFAR,     the\n\n\"supplemental\" brief to the SJC, and the relevant portion of the\n\nAppeals Court brief — the materials actually reviewed by the SJC —\n\nto determine whether Clements' sufficiency claim was exhausted.\n\n             In his ALOFAR, relying on Massachusetts cases, Clements\n\nurged the SJC to reverse his conviction because the \"inconsistent,\n\nrecanted, extra judicial grand jury testimony\" tying him to the\n\ncrime was not corroborated by any more reliable evidence, and\n\n\n\n     11\n       The government places significant weight on the fact that\nClements labeled his new brief simply as \"Brief\" and did not\ndesignate it a \"Supplemental\" brief. The title of the brief, as it\nappeared on the cover page, was \"Brief and Supplemental Record\nAppendix.\"   The government filed a responsive brief, which it\ntitled \"Supplemental Brief.\" We think the labels applied to these\nbriefs are not helpful and we give them no weight. Our assumption\nis, however, buttressed by a recent change in the Rules. In 2004,\nthe MRAP were modified so that a party who now elects to file a new\nbrief must rely exclusively on that brief; in other words, the\ncurrent rules require each party to submit to the SJC a single\nbrief, which can be either the Appeals Court brief or (with the\nSJC's permission) a new brief. Mass. R. App. P. 27.1 (f) (2004\nAmendment).   This change suggests that previously parties were\narguing in reliance on both the Appeals Court brief and the\n\"separate or supplemental\" brief.\n\n                                     -20-\n\ftherefore was insufficient under Commonwealth v. Daye, 393 Mass. 55\n\n(1984).    Clements argues that this claim was exhausted because his\n\nAppeals    Court       brief    included      a    citation    to    a   Supreme      Court\n\ndecision, Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 725 (1968), for the simple\n\nproposition that the right to confront adverse witnesses is \"a\n\ntrial right.\"12\n\n            We find it doubtful that this single cite to a Supreme\n\nCourt case is enough to satisfy the fair presentation requirement.\n\nHowever, Clements' Appeals Court brief did label this claim as\n\nfollows: \"The Court violated Clement's rights pursuant to the Sixth\n\nand   Fourteenth        Amendments       as       well   as   Article     XII    of    the\n\nMassachusetts Declaration of Rights, when it held at trial and on\n\nthe motion for a new trial that the jury could consider Willis'\n\ngrand jury identification as substantive evidence of Clement's\n\n[sic] guilt.\"          In Baldwin, the Supreme Court found that such\n\nlabeling    of     a    claim    would     be      enough     to    satisfy     the   fair\n\npresentation requirement. 541 U.S. at 32 (noting that a petitioner\n\nwho \"wish[es] to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the\n\nfederal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief,\n\nfor example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal\n\nsource of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on\n\n\n\n      12\n       Clements' ALOFAR and Supplemental Brief indisputably did not\nargue this claim on a federal law basis. The arguments therein\nrelied only on state law. The state cases cited by Clements also\ndid not rely upon federal law.\n\n                                           -21-\n\ffederal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim 'federal'\").\n\nTherefore, with this label the sufficiency claim was exhausted, and\n\nthe district court erred in ruling otherwise.\n\nC.   Clements' Four Other Claims\n\n           Clements' habeas petition included, in addition to the\n\nthree ALOFAR claims (the joint venture and sufficiency claims\n\ndiscussed above, and the jury hold-out claim found exhausted by the\n\ndistrict court), four additional claims.13      Three of these four\n\nclaims were presented to the Appeals Court, but none were raised\n\nbefore the SJC because they were not mentioned in the ALOFAR.14\n\n           Both Baldwin, 541 U.S. at 32, and Barresi, 296 F.3d at 52\n\nn.1, explicitly hold that claims omitted from an ALOFAR (or similar\n\npetition) are unexhausted.   See also Josselyn, 475 F.3d at 3 (\"We\n\nobserved [in Mele], that finding exhaustion where a claim appeared\n\nin the Appeals Court's decision but was omitted from the ALOFAR\n\n\n\n      13\n       One of these claims was presented in tandem with the jury\nhold-out claim, as described above. See supra note 3.\n     14\n        These claims were as follows: Habeas claim one was a due\nprocess violation of Clements' right to a fair trial, based on his\nabsence from the courtroom during the trial court's inquiry into\none of the juror's potential biases.      Habeas claim four was a\ncumulative error claim, based on all of the mistakes Clements\nalleges were made by the trial court. This claim was not mentioned\nby Clements in his brief filed with us. Habeas claim five was a\ndue process violation resulting from the trial court's admission of\nevidence of Clements' prior bad acts (namely, his prior and current\n— at the time of the crime — involvement with drug use and sales).\nThe second sub-part of habeas claim two, see supra note 3, argued\nthat the trial judge committed error in failing to order a mistrial\nafter the jury indicated its deadlock twice.\n\n                                -22-\n\fwould unfairly require 'the SJC to go over each and every opinion\n\nof the [Appeals Court] with a fine tooth comb, in an unremitting\n\nsearch     for   errors       that   the     parties    have   neglected     to\n\npursue . . . .'\") (second alteration in original)(quoting Mele, 850\n\nF.2d at 823).       The district court therefore correctly ruled that\n\nthese four claims, omitted from the ALOFAR, were not exhausted.\n\nD.   Nature of the Remand\n\n            We have now determined that, in addition to the jury\n\nhold-out    claim    deemed    exhausted     by   the   district   court,   the\n\nsufficiency claim was also exhausted.             Clements' habeas petition\n\nremains mixed, and he cannot proceed on a mixed petition.                   See\n\nRose, 455 U.S. at 520-22.            Where a petition is deemed mixed,\n\ndistrict courts must either dismiss the petition (in compliance\n\nwith the \"total exhaustion rule\" announced in Rose, id. at 522) or\n\npermit the petitioner to dismiss his unexhausted claims, id. at\n\n520.     Therefore, we remand the petition to the district court,\n\nwhere Clements should be given the opportunity to dismiss his\n\nunexhausted claims.       See Kelly v. Small, 315 F.3d 1063, 1069-70\n\n(9th Cir. 2003) (remanding an entire petition to the district\n\ncourt, after finding three claims exhausted despite district court\n\nfinding to the contrary, and instructing the district court to\n\nallow the petitioner an opportunity to dismiss unexhausted claims);\n\nsee also Vang v. Nevada, 329 F.3d 1069, 1076 (9th Cir. 2003);\n\nValerio v. Crawford, 306 F.3d 742, 771 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc);\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fRockwell v. Yukins, 217 F.3d 421, 425 (6th Cir. 2000); Murray v.\n\nWood, 107 F.3d 629, 632 (8th Cir. 1997).15   If Clements declines to\n\ndismiss his unexhausted claims, the district court should dismiss\n\nthe entire petition without prejudice.\n\n                                 III.\n\n            The final issue on appeal is the district court's denial\n\nof a stay of the entire petition to allow Clements to return to\n\nstate court with his unexhausted claims.      We affirm the court's\n\ndecision.   Although the court entered its provisional order before\n\nRhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269 (2005), was decided, and therefore\n\ndid not apply the standard articulated therein, its result is\n\nconsistent with that standard.\n\n            In Rhines, the Court identified the three prerequisites\n\nfor the \"stay and abeyance\" procedure.     Id. at 277.16   The phrase\n\n\"stay and abeyance\" means that the petitioner would receive a stay\n\nin his federal habeas case, permitting him to return to state court\n\nto complete the requirements for exhaustion on any unexhausted\n\n\n     15\n        One court has used a different approach, simply affirming\nthe dismissal of the unexhausted claims and remanding the exhausted\nclaims. See Akins v. Kenney, 341 F.3d 681, 687 (8th Cir. 2003),\nvacated on other grounds, 544 U.S. 957 (2005).\n     16\n       The \"stay and abeyance\" procedure is a response to AEDPA's\none-year statute of limitations and total exhaustion requirement;\nit was endorsed by a number of circuit courts, including ours,\nprior to the Supreme Court's decision in Rhines.       See, e.g.,\nNeverson v. Bissonnette, 261 F.3d 120, 126 n.3 (1st Cir. 2001);\nZarvela v. Artuz, 254 F.3d 374, 380 (2d Cir. 2001); Freeman v.\nPage, 208 F.3d 572, 577 (7th Cir. 2000); Calderon v. United States\nDist. Ct., 134 F.3d 981, 986-88 (9th Cir. 1998).\n\n                                 -24-\n\fclaims, and he could subsequently return to federal court to pursue\n\nhis habeas claims.   The Court held that this procedure would be\n\nappropriate where: (1) \"the district court determines there was\n\ngood cause for the petitioner's failure to exhaust his claims first\n\nin state court,\" id., (2) the \"unexhausted claims are potentially\n\nmeritorious,\" id. at 278, and (3) \"there is no indication that the\n\npetitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics,\"\n\nid.   In cases where these criteria are not satisfied, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that \"the [district] court should allow the petitioner\n\nto delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted\n\nclaims if dismissal of the entire petition would unreasonably\n\nimpair the petitioner's right to obtain federal relief.\"   Id.\n\n           Although the district court did not have the benefit of\n\nthe Rhines decision before issuing its provisional order, it\n\nnonetheless engaged in a version of a \"good cause\" analysis.17   The\n\ncourt found that the omission of most of Clements' Appeals Court\n\nclaims from his ALOFAR was the result of a strategic decision by\n\nClements and his lawyer and could not constitute good cause.\n\n\n      17\n       The court began its analysis by observing that, in its view,\n\"staying the petition pending the pursuit of new relief in the\nstate courts should be reserved only for exceptional cases where it\nwould be inequitable or unjust to do otherwise, such as where it\nwas impossible or impracticable for the petitioner to have pursued\nthe unexhausted claims in the state proceedings that resolved the\nexhausted ones.\" 359 F. Supp. 2d at 12. This language suggests\nthat the district court may have used a more rigorous test than the\nSupreme Court's good cause standard.      However, as we indicate\nbelow, Clements fails to satisfy either standard, so the difference\nis irrelevant.\n\n                               -25-\n\f          Clements has argued that all of his unexhausted claims\n\nshould be stayed, pending his return to state court, because of his\n\n(and his counsel's) good faith reliance on the Massachusetts Rules\n\nof Appellate Procedure. He contends that he filed his ALOFAR while\n\nbelieving that the entire Appeals Court brief would be \"presented\n\nto\" the SJC, and thus would be included in the exhaustion analysis.\n\n          As to the four habeas claims omitted entirely from the\n\nALOFAR, the intentional decision to omit some claims from the\n\nALOFAR cannot amount to good cause.    We have a long-standing rule\n\nthat claims ommitted entirely from an ALOFAR cannot be exhausted.\n\nSee Mele v. Fitchburg Dist. Court, 850 F.2d 817, 820-23 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).   Therefore, Clements could not have had good cause for\n\nfailing to exhaust these claims, and his reliance on the MRAP is\n\nirrelevant.   See Josselyn v. Dennehy, 475 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(affirming the district court's denial of a stay and abeyance,\n\nwhere petitioner asserted good cause for his failure to exhaust\n\nbased on counsel's belief that arguments omitted from an ALOFAR\n\nmight still be exhausted).    The district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in holding that Clements' decision to omit these claims\n\nfrom his ALOFAR does not amount to good cause.\n\n          Clements has not presented us with a specific argument\n\nabout the cause for his failure to exhaust the joint venture claim\n\n(which was included in the ALOFAR, but only on state law grounds).\n\nAs to this claim, he again relies on his more general argument\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fthat, based on the MRAP, he and his counsel had a good faith belief\n\nthat the Appeals Court brief would be \"incorporated\" into the\n\nALOFAR    and,   thus,   included   within   our   exhaustion   analysis.\n\nInherent in this argument is the notion that the federal cases\n\ncited in the Appeals Court brief in support of the joint venture\n\nclaim would suffice to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.\n\n            As we have explained above, see supra Part II.B, the 2001\n\nversion of the MRAP did not, as Clements suggests, result in\n\npresentation of the full Appeals Court brief to the SJC.             His\n\ninterpretation of the rules was unjustified.         To the extent that\n\nClements has also implicitly argued that he relied on the Barresi\n\n\"backdrop\" principle in deciding how to articulate the claims\n\nwithin the ALOFAR, we find that argument to be implausible.        At the\n\ntime Clements' ALOFAR was filed, in June 2001, our court had not\n\nyet decided Barresi.     Therefore, Clements could not have relied on\n\nBarresi in his decision to present the joint venture claim only on\n\nstate grounds.18     Moreover, at that time, Mele, 850 F.2d at 823,\n\n\n     18\n       We note that Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 7 n.3 (1st Cir.\n1994), had some language suggesting the possibility of inclusion of\nlower court filings in the exhaustion analysis. Scarpa was, in a\nsense, a harbinger of Barresi. However, Scarpa did not profess to\nalter the \"four corners\" rule previously articulated in Mele v.\nFitchburg Dist. Court, 850 F.2d 817 (1st Cir. 1988), and seemed to\nbe limited to its facts. Moreover, the outcome in Scarpa did not\nrely on its implicit pre-Barresi logic; we held that the relevant\nstate law claim presented in the ALOFAR was \"functionally\nidentical\" to a federal claim, and therefore was exhausted, id. at\n7, based on our decision in Nadworny v. Fair, 872 F.2d 1093, 1099-\n1100. In addition, Clements has never claimed that he relied on\nScarpa when filing his ALOFAR. For all of these reasons, we do not\n\n                                    -27-\n\fwas the guiding precedent in our circuit and it clearly held that\n\nfederal claims ought to be \"raised within the four corners of the\n\nALOFAR.\"   Neither the state rules nor our decisions, then, could\n\nhave justified Clements' decision to argue the joint venture claim\n\nexclusively on state law grounds.            He has not shown good cause for\n\nhis failure to exhaust this claim.\n\n           Clements' lack of good cause means that, under Rhines, he\n\ncannot   take   advantage   of   the    \"stay     and   abeyance\"    procedure.\n\nTherefore, we affirm the denial of a stay.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n           In summary, we affirm the district court's decision\n\nfinding five of Clements' claims unexhausted.                We reverse the\n\ndistrict court as to Clements' sufficiency claim.                   His Appeals\n\nCourt brief, which was properly before the SJC under the 2001\n\nversion of MRAP 27.1, satisfied the exhaustion requirement by\n\nlabeling that claim as federal.          The petition is remanded to the\n\ndistrict court, so that Clements may decide whether to dismiss his\n\nunexhausted claims.    We also affirm the district court's denial of\n\na stay of his unexhausted claims pending Clements' return to state\n\ncourt.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\nfind that Clements' failure to exhaust can be explained by our\ndecision in Scarpa.\n\n                                   -28-\n\f",

Although we note the possibility that a portion of one of our prior decisions, <i>Barresi v. Maloney,</i> 296 F.3d 48 (1st Cir.2002), might no longer be valid in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Baldwin v. Reese,</i> 541 U.S. 27, 124 S.Ct. 1347, 158 L.Ed.2d 64 (2004), we need not decide that question here. We conclude that the habeas petitioner in this case succeeded in exhausting one claim, which the district court found unexhausted, because of the then-existing Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure. We also find, however, that another claim was properly deemed unexhausted by the district court because the state rules do not reach as far as the petitioner has suggested. We therefore affirm in part, reverse in part and remand as to one claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. State Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the specific facts of the crime underlying this case are not particularly relevant, we recount them only briefly, with the rebuttable presumption that factual findings by the state courts are correct. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1). A more complete recitation of the facts can be found in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's (\"SJC\") opinion, <i>Commonwealth v. Clements,</i> 436 Mass. 190, 763 N.E.2d 55 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements was convicted of murdering Gregory Tillery in 1995. Tillery was shot on a street corner by a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt. An eyewitness identified Clements as the killer while testifying before the grand jury, but recanted that testimony at trial. The remainder of the evidence presented by the government was circumstantial. Clements was convicted on charges of murder in the second degree by joint venture, armed assault with intent to murder, and unlicensed possession of a gun. A co-defendant was acquitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements was given a life sentence, and he immediately appealed his convictions. His motion for a new trial was denied, and he appealed that decision as well. Clements made nine separate legal arguments to the Appeals Court, but his conviction was affirmed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Thereafter, he filed an Application for Leave to Obtain Further Appellate Review (ALOFAR) with the SJC, raising only three legal claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC granted further appellate review, limited to the sufficiency claim, and affirmed the conviction. The SJC held that the recanted testimony was not the sole evidence of guilt, as Clements claimed, and that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Clements' argument in support of this claim, both in his ALOFAR and his supplemental brief to the SJC, relied exclusively on state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Federal Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the SJC rejected his direct appeal, Clements filed this habeas petition in the district court raising six legal claims. Three of them were the ones included in the ALOFAR. Two of the other three had been argued to the state Appeals Court. One had not previously been raised in any court. In response to the state's motion to dismiss, Clements argued that he had fully exhausted his state remedies on all six claims and that, if some claims were found unexhausted, he should be granted a stay in federal court so that he could return to state court to exhaust his remaining claims without fear of exceeding AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations. The district court carefully reviewed the claims Clements raised in his habeas petition, looking first at the claims that had been included in his ALOFAR and then at the claims excluded therefrom, and concluded that only the jury hold-out claim was exhausted because it was the only one \"fairly presented by the petitioner for review as a federal claim.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More specifically, the court found that both the sufficiency and the joint venture claims were presented to the SJC solely as state law claims and that they therefore had not been exhausted. As to both of these claims, the district court stated that no federal cases were cited and the ALOFAR did not articulate any federal issues in a recognizable way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the claims raised in the habeas petition that had not appeared in the ALOFAR, the court found that three of these claims were presented to the Appeals Court as state law claims, while two were originally argued in reliance on both state and federal law. One claim appeared in the habeas petition, despite not being raised before either the Appeals Court or SJC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Clements argued that all of these claims had some basis in federal law, and that they ought to be found exhausted because a review of the brief filed with the Appeals Court revealed those federal bases. The district court found Clements' arguments meritless because the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Baldwin v. Reese,</i> 541 U.S. 27, 32, 124 S.Ct. 1347, 158 L.Ed.2d 64 (2004), held that a claim cannot be exhausted if it is not presented directly to the state's highest court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court rejected Clements' request for a stay of his habeas petition because the failure to exhaust was a result of \"deliberate,\" \"tactical\" decisions by Clements' counsel. The court noted our decision in <i>Neverson v. Bissonnette,</i> 261 F.3d 120, 126 n. 3 (1st Cir.2001), which endorsed granting stays in certain cases, but concluded that this case did not merit a stay. The district court issued a provisional decision, allowing Clements to decide whether to proceed in federal court on his single exhausted claim (by voluntarily dismissing the other, unexhausted claims) or to dismiss his whole petition and return to state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements requested additional time to respond to the district court's provisional order, citing the Supreme Court's then-recent decision regarding \"mixed\" habeas petitions, <i>Rhines v. Weber,</i> 544 U.S. 269, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The request was granted and Clements subsequently informed the district court that he would not voluntarily dismiss any of his habeas claims (in order to proceed with the exhausted claim), and that he \"fe[lt] strongly that the Supreme Court's decision [in] <i>Rhines v. Weber</i> supports his request for a[s]tay.\" The district court then dismissed Clements' petition pursuant to its earlier provisional order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement that habeas petitioners exhaust all available state remedies was originally imposed by the Supreme Court in <i>Rose v. Lundy,</i> 455 U.S. 509, 518, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982). Subsequently, Congress codified the requirement as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(b)(1)(A), and also added a one year statute of limitations for the filing of habeas petitions, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2244(d). Regardless of its source, the exhaustion requirement has long served to infuse into our habeas jurisprudence the interests of comity and federalism. <i>See, e.g., Rose,</i> 455 U.S. at 518-19, 102 S.Ct. 1198 (finding that \"`it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation,'\" and that \"[a] rigorously enforced total exhaustion rule will encourage state prisoners to seek full relief first from the state courts, thus giving those courts the first opportunity to review all claims of constitutional error\") (quoting <i>Darr v. Burford,</i> 339 U.S. 200, 204, 70 S.Ct. 587, 94 L.Ed. 761 (1950)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to exhaust a claim, the petitioner must \"present the federal claim fairly and recognizably\" to the state courts, meaning that he \"must show that he tendered his federal claim `in such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the federal question.'\" <i>Casella v. Clemons,</i> 207 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>Adelson v. DiPaola,</i> 131 F.3d 259, 262 (1st Cir.1997)). This means that \"the legal theory [articulated] in the state and federal courts must be the same.\" <i>Gagne v. Fair,</i> 835 F.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir.1987). This standard must be met, as a general rule, by \"fairly present[ing]\" a federal claim \"within the four corners of the ALOFAR.\" <i>Mele v. Fitchburg Dist. Ct.,</i> 850 F.2d 817, 823 (1st Cir.1988). We have previously held that a habeas petitioner may accomplish this by doing any of the following: (1) citing a provision of the federal constitution; (2) presenting a federal constitutional claim in a manner that fairly alerts the state court to the federal nature of the claim; (3) citing federal constitutional precedents; or (4) claiming violation of a right specifically protected in the federal constitution. <i>Gagne,</i> 835 F.2d at 7. We have also noted that, in some situations, citations to state court decisions which rely on federal law or articulation of a state claim that is, \"as a practical matter, [] indistinguishable from one arising under federal law,\" may suffice to satisfy the exhaustion requirement. <i>Nadworny v. Fair,</i> 872 F.2d 1093, 1099-1100 (1st Cir. 1989). It is, however, clearly inadequate to simply recite the facts underlying a state claim, where those facts might support either a federal or state claim. <i>Martens v. Shannon,</i> 836 F.2d 715, 717 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements contends that all six of his habeas claims have satisfied the exhaustion requirement because they were all presented to the Appeals Court with some citation or reference to federal cases. He explains that our precedent, <i>Barresi v. Maloney</i> 296 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir.2002), permitting us to review certain \"backdrop\" materials in some cases, in combination with Massachusetts' procedural rules, effectively renders his brief to the Appeals Court \"presented\" to the SJC, meaning that all the arguments he made before the Appeals Court were made to the SJC. The government responds by arguing that our decision in <i>Barresi</i> has been invalidated by the Supreme Court's more recent decision in <i>Baldwin v. Reese,</i> 541 U.S. 27, 124 S.Ct. 1347, 158 L.Ed.2d 64 (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the two claims that were presented in the ALOFAR, which the district court found to be unexhausted: first the joint venture claim and then the sufficiency claim. We will briefly comment on the government's argument about the continued vitality of our <i>Barresi</i> decision in the context of the joint venture claim. We then turn to the claims that were omitted entirely from the ALOFAR. Our review of the district court's decision regarding exhaustion is de novo. <i>Goodrich v. Hall,</i> 448 F.3d 45, 47 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Barresi,</i> 296 F.3d at 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Joint Venture Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of Clements' three ALOFAR claims &#8212; the joint venture claim &#8212; was presented to the SJC solely in terms of state law. The portion of Clements' ALOFAR discussing this claim relied on no federal cases and did not label the claim as federal. It also made no arguments using vague (and possibly federal law based) phrases, such as \"due process.\" Clements argues, nonetheless, that this claim was exhausted because, under <i>Barresi,</i> 296 F.3d at 52, the exhaustion analysis should include a review of \"backdrop\" materials, such as the Appeals Court brief, wherein he says that the federal nature of his claim was made clear. In order to evaluate this claim, we must determine whether <i>Barresi</i> applies to a claim styled like Clements' joint venture claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Barresi v. Maloney</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Barresi,</i> we held that, where a claim has not been abandoned before the state's highest court, the exhaustion analysis includes an examination of the \"`backdrop against which [] later filings [must] be viewed,'\" 296 F.3d at 52 (second alteration in original) (quoting <i>Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> 38 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1994)), and that backdrop includes \"the pleadings and filings submitted . . . to lower state courts,\" <i>id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Barresi</i> also recognized the continued validity of the \"four corners rule,\" <i>see Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 821-23, and held that the \"backdrop\" materials could only be consulted \"under certain circumstances.\" 296 F.3d at 52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that time, we did not specify what those limited circumstances might be. However, in <i>Barresi</i> itself, the ALOFAR at issue included claims regarding the right to confront adverse witnesses and due process, both of which are claims that may be grounded either in state law or federal law or both, and cited state court cases that relied upon federal law. <i>Id.</i> at 53-54. Therefore, we found that Barresi's ALOFAR minimally satisfied the exhaustion requirement. As part of the explanation for that conclusion, we noted that the same claims had been raised in the intermediate appellate brief, where Barresi had directly cited federal precedents. <i>Id.</i> at 55-56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have subsequently said that the <i>Barresi</i> backdrop rule applies only in cases where the ALOFAR (or other petition to a state supreme court) was ambiguous about the federal nature of a claim, as it was in <i>Barresi. See Josselyn v. Dennehy,</i> 475 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.2007) (noting that <i>Barresi's</i> \"backdrop\" principle applies when there is ambiguity in the ALOFAR regarding the federal nature of the claim); <i>Goodrich,</i> 448 F.3d at 48 (reviewing the petitioner's lower court briefs as part of the exhaustion analysis, because the ALOFAR relied primarily on state cases, but was somewhat ambiguous about the source of the legal claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this case involves an ALOFAR that was not ambiguous, the <i>Barresi</i> \"backdrop\" principle, assuming it is still valid, provides no assistance to Clements. We add that qualifier about the continuing validity of the \"backdrop\" principle because of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Baldwin v. Reese.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Baldwin,</i> 541 U.S. at 32, 124 S.Ct. 1347, the Court held that, where a federal claim was not included in a petition, the exhaustion analysis could not encompass materials beyond the petition or brief filed with the state's highest court. In that case, the defendant had filed a petition seeking discretionary appellate review by the Oregon Supreme Court and had argued some claims based on federal law and other claims based only on state law. The defendant later filed a habeas petition and argued that at least one of the claims which was presented on state law grounds could be deemed exhausted because a review of the intermediate appellate court opinion showed that he had made federal law arguments on that claim below. Pursuant to Oregon's procedural rules, Oregon's Supreme Court justices had access to the lower court opinions in cases for which a petition was filed, but their rules did not require them to review such opinions. <i>Id.</i> at 31, 124 S.Ct. 1347. Rather, the rules required a party seeking review to assert all claims in the appellate brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset of its analysis, the Supreme Court noted its assumption that the defendant's \"petition by itself did not properly alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of\" the claim. <i>Id.</i> at 30, 124 S.Ct. 1347.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The Court then reasoned that, in such a context, permitting the exhaustion inquiry to include a review of the lower court opinion simply because the state court judges had an \"opportunity\" to review it would effectively mean \"that those judges <i>must</i> read the lower court opinions &#8212; for otherwise they would forfeit the State's opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 31, 124 S.Ct. 1347. The Supreme Court found that burden incompatible with the \"considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.\" <i>Id.</i> at 32, 124 S.Ct. 1347. Therefore, the Court held that \"ordinarily a state prisoner does not `fairly present' a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief ... that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material ... that does so.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Barresi</i> approach to the exhaustion analysis may be incompatible with <i>Baldwin. Barresi</i> permits us to consider lower court pleadings or opinions where the state court did not (and was not required to) consider them itself. However, as we have explained, we subsequently limited the <i>Barresi</i> backdrop principle to cases in which there is an ambiguity in the ALOFAR about the federal nature of the claim. Whether <i>Baldwin</i> forecloses consideration of backdrop materials even in cases of ambiguous petitions is a question we need not decide here because Clements' joint venture claim is unmistakably couched only in state law terms. We therefore reserve the issue of the continuing validity of <i>Barresi's</i> backdrop principle for a case in which it is directly raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Massachusetts' Procedural Rules</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements offers an alternative to his <i>Barresi</i> argument in support of his claim that he fairly presented his joint venture claim to the SJC. He argues that Massachusetts Rule of Appellate Procedure (\"MRAP\") 27.1 permits him to rely on the brief that he filed with the Massachusetts Appeals Court to demonstrate the exhaustion of his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MRAP Rule 27.1 says that the full Appeals Court record should be transferred to the SJC after further appellate review is granted. At the time of Clements' appeal, the rule also stated that the SJC appeal would be conducted on the basis of the Appeals Court briefs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See infra</i> note 11 (explaining subsequent alteration of this rule). Clements contends that after further appellate review is granted (regardless of whether it is a limited or general grant<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>), the entire Appeals Court brief is properly \"before\" the SJC, in the same way that the arguments contained in the ALOFAR were before the SJC. He contends that MRAP 27.1 has the effect, therefore, of rendering <i>all</i> the arguments he presented to the lower court exhausted because the SJC was in possession of the full Appeals Court record, including his Appeals Court brief. Citing this \"possession,\" and the provision regarding reliance on the Appeals Court brief, Clements claims that the SJC is actually <i>required</i> by state rules to review the lower court papers. Consequently, he argues, his Appeals Court brief should be treated as a part of the SJC's evaluation of his claim, just as the ALOFAR is so treated, and not as additional or independent backdrop material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements' argument mis-understands the significance of a limited grant of further appellate review. Clements relies on the provision which allows an appeal, after further review has been granted, to be argued on the basis of the Appeals Court brief for his contention that the entire brief (not just the portion relevant to a limited grant) must be reviewed by the SJC. <i>See Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 822 (noting that MRAP 27.1 requires the lower court record to be forwarded to the SJC \"only if &#8212; and <i>after</i> &#8212; it grants an ALOFAR\"). As we have noted, the SJC in this case granted further review on only one issue (the sufficiency claim). Under Massachusetts rules, when the SJC issues a limited grant, it does not decide any issues beyond the one (or ones) granted review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> For this reason, the formal transfer of the Appeals Court record to the SJC does <i>not</i> require the SJC to review briefing or other materials relating to issues beyond the one(s) for which review was granted. Here, the SJC's receipt of the lower court record, including the Appeals Court brief, is relevant only to the one issue (sufficiency of the evidence) on which it exercised its appellate jurisdiction. On the issues for which review was denied, such as the joint venture claim, the physical transfer of the record and the use of the Appeals Court brief for argument on the sufficiency claim are irrelevant to the exhaustion inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find further support for this conclusion in the general principles articulated in <i>Baldwin,</i> 541 U.S. at 31-32, 124 S.Ct. 1347. Clements' interpretation of MRAP 27.1 would effectively require the SJC to read and evaluate all of the arguments presented to the lower court after even a limited grant of further review, which is precisely what <i>Baldwin</i> sought to preclude. In claiming that a limited grant of further review places the full record (including both the trial court and appeals court proceedings) before the SJC, and that the exhaustion analysis should encompass that full record, Clements invites the federal habeas court to ignore the state's procedural rules. However, disregarding the difference between a limited grant and a general grant would contravene <i>Baldwin. Baldwin</i> clearly limits the exhaustion analysis to the materials that a state's highest court reviewed while deciding whether to grant a discretionary appeal or evaluating such an appeal on its merits. <i>Id.</i> at 32, 124 S.Ct. 1347. Materials that are merely accessible to that court are not to be reviewed in an exhaustion inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under MRAP 27.1, the portion of the Appeals Court brief relating to the joint venture claim was not before the SJC when it reviewed Clements' appeal on the merits. Therefore, our review of the district court's finding that the joint venture claim was not exhausted must be based solely on the contents of the ALOFAR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Exhaustion of the Joint Venture Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements has not sought to persuade us that his ALOFAR described, or even hinted at, a federal basis for his joint venture claim. The ALOFAR's discussion of this claim refers only to state law, and none of the cited state cases relied on federal law. The federal basis for the claim was not presented \"fairly and recognizably,\" <i>Casella,</i> 207 F.3d at 20, nor did Clements articulate a federal law argument \"in such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the federal question,\" <i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 6. Without any references, explicit or implicit, to federal law or principles, the ALOFAR's presentation of the joint venture claim did not apprise the SJC of a possible federal error in the state court's decision. Therefore, we agree with the district court's conclusion that the joint venture claim was not exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Sufficiency Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the joint venture claim, the SJC granted Clements further appellate review for his sufficiency claim. This important fact distinguishes our analysis of this claim from all other claims in this case, as well as the claims discussed in recent cases such as <i>Goodrich,</i> 448 F.3d at 47, and <i>Josselyn,</i> 475 F.3d at 3-4 (where the claims at issue were not even mentioned in the ALOFAR and were deemed abandoned when the ALOFAR was filed with the SJC). The grant of further appellate review is significant, as we have explained, because of the procedural rules in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to a 2001 amendment, MRAP 27.1(f) stated that after further appellate review is granted, a party may elect to proceed with the appeal before the SJC on the basis of the Appeals Court brief previously filed or may petition for permission to submit a new (\"separate or supplemental\") brief. <i>See</i> Mass. R.App. P. Reporter's Notes &#8212; 2001. Clements requested, and was granted, permission to file a new brief. At the time of Clements' appeal, the Massachusetts Rules did not expressly indicate whether the new brief would be considered exclusively or alongside the Appeals Court brief. Because the Rules said that a new brief may be supplemental, we assume here that the SJC reviewed both the Appeals Court brief (on the sufficiency issue <i>only</i>) and the new or supplemental brief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Therefore, we examine the ALOFAR, the \"supplemental\" brief to the SJC, and the relevant portion of the Appeals Court brief &#8212; the materials actually reviewed by the SJC &#8212; to determine whether Clements' sufficiency claim was exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his ALOFAR, relying on Massachusetts cases, Clements urged the SJC to reverse his conviction because the \"inconsistent, recanted, extra judicial grand jury testimony\" tying him to the crime was not corroborated by any more reliable evidence, and therefore was insufficient under <i>Commonwealth v. Daye,</i> 393 Mass. 55, 469 N.E.2d 483 (1984). Clements argues that this claim was exhausted because his Appeals Court brief included a citation to a Supreme Court decision, <i>Barber v. Page,</i> 390 U.S. 719, 725, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968), for the simple proposition that the right to confront adverse witnesses is \"a trial right.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find it doubtful that this single cite to a Supreme Court case is enough to satisfy the fair presentation requirement. However, Clements' Appeals Court brief did label this claim as follows: \"The Court violated Clement's rights pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments as well as Article XII of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, when it held at trial and on the motion for a new trial that the jury could consider Willis' grand jury identification as substantive evidence of Clement's [sic] guilt.\" In <i>Baldwin,</i> the Supreme Court found that such labeling of a claim would be enough to satisfy the fair presentation requirement. 541 U.S. at 32, 124 S.Ct. 1347 (noting that a petitioner who \"wish[es] to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim `federal'\"). Therefore, with this label the sufficiency claim was exhausted, and the district court erred in ruling otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Clements' Four Other Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements' habeas petition included, in addition to the three ALOFAR claims (the joint venture and sufficiency claims discussed above, and the jury hold-out claim found exhausted by the district court), four additional claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Three of these four claims were presented to the Appeals Court, but none were raised before the SJC because they were not mentioned in the ALOFAR.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both <i>Baldwin,</i> 541 U.S. at 32, 124 S.Ct. 1347, and <i>Barresi,</i> 296 F.3d at 52 n. 1, explicitly hold that claims omitted from an ALOFAR (or similar petition) are unexhausted. <i>See also Josselyn,</i> 475 F.3d at 3 (\"We observed [in <i>Mele</i>], that finding exhaustion where a claim appeared in the Appeals Court's decision but was omitted from the ALOFAR would unfairly require `the SJC to go over each and every opinion of the [Appeals Court] with a fine tooth comb, in an unremitting search for errors that the parties have neglected to pursue ....'\") (second alteration in original)(quoting <i>Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 823). The district court therefore correctly ruled that these four claims, omitted from the ALOFAR, were not exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Nature of the Remand</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have now determined that, in addition to the jury hold-out claim deemed exhausted by the district court, the sufficiency claim was also exhausted. Clements' habeas petition remains mixed, and he cannot proceed on a mixed petition. <i>See Rose,</i> 455 U.S. at 520-22, 102 S.Ct. 1198. Where a petition is deemed mixed, district courts must either dismiss the petition (in compliance with the \"total exhaustion rule\" announced in <i>Rose, id.</i> at 522, 102 S.Ct. 1198) or permit the petitioner to dismiss his unexhausted claims, <i>id.</i> at 520, 102 S.Ct. 1198. Therefore, we remand the petition to the district court, where Clements should be given the opportunity to dismiss his unexhausted claims. <i>See Kelly v. Small,</i> 315 F.3d 1063, 1069-70 (9th Cir.2003) (remanding an entire petition to the district court, after finding three claims exhausted despite district court finding to the contrary, and instructing the district court to allow the petitioner an opportunity to dismiss unexhausted claims); <i>see also Vang v. Nevada,</i> 329 F.3d 1069, 1076 (9th Cir.2003); <i>Valerio v. Crawford,</i> 306 F.3d 742, 771 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc); <i>Rockwell v. Yukins,</i> 217 F.3d 421, 425 (6th Cir.2000); <i>Murray v. Wood,</i> 107 F.3d 629, 632 (8th Cir.1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> If Clements declines to dismiss his unexhausted claims, the district court should dismiss the entire petition without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final issue on appeal is the district court's denial of a stay of the entire petition to allow Clements to return to state court with his unexhausted claims. We affirm the court's decision. Although the court entered its provisional order before <i>Rhines v. Weber,</i> 544 U.S. 269, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005), was decided, and therefore did not apply the standard articulated therein, its result is consistent with that standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Rhines,</i> the Court identified the three prerequisites for the \"stay and abeyance\" procedure. <i>Id.</i> at 277, 125 S.Ct. 1528.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The phrase \"stay and abeyance\" means that the petitioner would receive a stay in his federal habeas case, permitting him to return to state court to complete the requirements for exhaustion on any unexhausted claims, and he could subsequently return to federal court to pursue his habeas claims. The Court held that this procedure would be appropriate where: (1) \"the district court determines there was good cause for the petitioner's failure to exhaust his claims first in state court,\" <i>id.,</i> (2) the \"unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious,\" <i>id.</i> at 278, 125 S.Ct. 1528, and (3) \"there is no indication that the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics,\" <i>id.</i> In cases where these criteria are not satisfied, the Supreme Court held that \"the [district] court should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims if dismissal of the entire petition would unreasonably impair the petitioner's right to obtain federal relief.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not have the benefit of the <i>Rhines</i> decision before issuing its provisional order, it nonetheless engaged in a version of a \"good cause\" analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> The court found that the omission of most of Clements' Appeals Court claims from his ALOFAR was the result of a strategic decision by Clements and his lawyer and could not constitute good cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements has argued that all of his unexhausted claims should be stayed, pending his return to state court, because of his (and his counsel's) good faith reliance on the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure. He contends that he filed his ALOFAR while believing that the entire Appeals Court brief would be \"presented to\" the SJC, and thus would be included in the exhaustion analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the four habeas claims omitted entirely from the ALOFAR, the intentional decision to omit some claims from the ALOFAR cannot amount to good cause. We have a long-standing rule that claims ommitted entirely from an ALOFAR cannot be exhausted. <i>See Mele v. Fitchburg Dist. Court,</i> 850 F.2d 817, 820-23 (1st Cir.1988). Therefore, Clements could not have had good cause for failing to exhaust these claims, and his reliance on the MRAP is irrelevant. <i>See Josselyn v. Dennehy,</i> 475 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007) (affirming the district court's denial of a stay and abeyance, where petitioner asserted good cause for his failure to exhaust based on counsel's belief that arguments omitted from an ALOFAR might still be exhausted). The district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Clements' decision to omit these claims from his ALOFAR does not amount to good cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements has not presented us with a specific argument about the cause for his failure to exhaust the joint venture claim (which was included in the ALOFAR, but only on state law grounds). As to this claim, he again relies on his more general argument that, based on the MRAP, he and his counsel had a good faith belief that the Appeals Court brief would be \"incorporated\" into the ALOFAR and, thus, included within our exhaustion analysis. Inherent in this argument is the notion that the federal cases cited in the Appeals Court brief in support of the joint venture claim would suffice to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have explained above, <i>see supra</i> Part II.B, the 2001 version of the MRAP did not, as Clements suggests, result in presentation of the <i>full</i> Appeals Court brief to the SJC. His interpretation of the rules was unjustified. To the extent that Clements has also implicitly argued that he relied on the <i>Barresi</i> \"backdrop\" principle in deciding how to articulate the claims within the ALOFAR, we find that argument to be implausible. At the time Clements' ALOFAR was filed, in June 2001, our court had not yet decided <i>Barresi.</i> Therefore, Clements could not have relied on <i>Barresi</i> in his decision to present the joint venture claim only on state grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Moreover, at that time, <i>Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 823, was the guiding precedent in our circuit and it clearly held that federal claims ought to be \"raised within the four corners of the ALOFAR.\" Neither the state rules nor our decisions, then, could have justified Clements' decision to argue the joint venture claim exclusively on state law grounds. He has not shown good cause for his failure to exhaust this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements' lack of good cause means that, under <i>Rhines,</i> he cannot take advantage of the \"stay and abeyance\" procedure. Therefore, we affirm the denial of a stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we affirm the district court's decision finding five of Clements' claims unexhausted. We reverse the district court as to Clements' sufficiency claim. His Appeals Court brief, which was properly before the SJC under the 2001 version of MRAP 27.1, satisfied the exhaustion requirement by labeling that claim as federal. The petition is remanded to the district court, so that Clements may decide whether to dismiss his unexhausted claims. We also affirm the district court's denial of a stay of his unexhausted claims pending Clements' return to state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The nine legal claims presented to the Appeals Court were described in some detail by the district court<i>See Clements v.

Therefore, the petition in<i>Baldwin</i> was, in a certain sense, ambiguous, much like the ALOFAR in <i>Barresi,</i> because a reasonable jurist might have concluded that the defendant intended to make state and federal arguments as to both claims, given that they were based on the same legal principle, and that he simply failed to explicitly articulate federal law grounds for the claim concerning appellate counsel.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Massachusetts Rule of Appellate Procedure 27.1 reads in part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Within twenty days after the date of the rescript of the Appeals Court any party to the appeal may file an application for leave to obtain further appellate review of the case by the full Supreme Judicial Court....

It may reject an ALOFAR outright, thereby affirming the Appeals Court decision without further argument or explanation. It may also grant an ALOFAR, thereby exercising its discretionary jurisdiction over the appeal and agreeing to consider all of the legal questions raised in that appeal. Or, the SJC may issue a limited grant in response to an ALOFAR, meaning that it has agreed to consider a single discrete issue (or multiple issues, but fewer than all) on appeal<i>See infra</i> note 10. In this case, the SJC chose the last of these options, and thus reviewed only one of the three issues presented to it in Clements' ALOFAR.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> By contrast, if the SJC issues a general grant of further appellate review, it may review any issue in the case, regardless of whether the appellant specifically raised it in the ALOFAR. In other words, a general grant renders the entire Appeals Court record subject to the SJC's jurisdiction, while a limited grant places only discrete issues within the SJC's jurisdiction<i>See Bradford v. Baystate Med. Ctr.,</i> 415 Mass. 202, 613 N.E.2d 82, 85 (1993).

The title of the brief, as it appeared on the cover page, was \"Brief and Supplemental Record Appendix.\" The government filed a responsive brief, which it titled \"Supplemental Brief.\" We think the labels applied to these briefs are not helpful and we give them no weight. Our assumption is, however, buttressed by a recent change in the Rules. In 2004, the MRAP were modified so that a party who now elects to file a new brief must rely exclusively on that brief; in other words, the current rules require each party to submit to the SJC a single brief, which can be either the Appeals Court brief or (with the SJC's permission) a new brief.

We conclude that the habeas petitioner in this case succeeded in exhausting one claim, which the district court found unexhausted, because of the then-existing Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure. We also find, however, that another claim was properly deemed unexhausted by the district court because the state rules do not reach as far as the petitioner has suggested.

Tillery was shot on a street corner by a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt. An eyewitness identified Clements as the killer while testifying before the grand jury, but recanted that testimony at trial. The remainder of the evidence presented by the government was circumstantial. Clements was convicted on charges of murder in the second degree by joint venture, armed assault with intent to murder, and unlicensed possession of a gun. A co-defendant was acquitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements was given a life sentence, and he immediately appealed his convictions. His motion for a new trial was denied, and he appealed that decision as well. Clements made nine separate legal arguments to the Appeals Court, but his conviction was affirmed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Thereafter, he filed an Application for Leave to Obtain Further Appellate Review (ALOFAR) with the SJC, raising only three legal claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC granted further appellate review, limited to the sufficiency claim, and affirmed the conviction. The SJC held that the recanted testimony was not the sole evidence of guilt, as Clements claimed, and that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Clements' argument in support of this claim, both in his ALOFAR and his supplemental brief to the SJC, relied exclusively on state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Federal Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the SJC rejected his direct appeal, Clements filed this habeas petition in the district court raising six legal claims. Three of them were the ones included in the ALOFAR. Two of the other three had been argued to the state Appeals Court. One had not previously been raised in any court. In response to the state's motion to dismiss, Clements argued that he had fully exhausted his state remedies on all six claims and that, if some claims were found unexhausted, he should be granted a stay in federal court so that he could return to state court to exhaust his remaining claims without fear of exceeding AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations. The district court carefully reviewed the claims Clements raised in his habeas petition, looking first at the claims that had been included in his ALOFAR and then at the claims excluded therefrom, and concluded that only the jury hold-out claim was exhausted because it was the only one \"fairly presented by the petitioner for review as a federal claim.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More specifically, the court found that both the sufficiency and the joint venture claims were presented to the SJC solely as state law claims and that they therefore had not been exhausted. As to both of these claims, the district court stated that no federal cases were cited and the ALOFAR did not articulate any federal issues in a recognizable way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the claims raised in the habeas petition that had not appeared in the ALOFAR, the court found that three of these claims were presented to the Appeals Court as state law claims, while two were originally argued in reliance on both state and federal law. One claim appeared in the habeas petition, despite not being raised before either the Appeals Court or SJC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Clements argued that all of these claims had some basis in federal law, and that they ought to be found exhausted because a review of the brief filed with the Appeals Court revealed those federal bases.

DuBois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680706\"><a href=\"/opinion/680706/nazzaro-scarpa-v-larry-e-dubois-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1994)), and that backdrop includes \"the pleadings and filings submitted . . . to lower state courts,\" <i>id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Barresi</i> also recognized the continued validity of the \"four corners rule,\" <i>see Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 821-23, and held that the \"backdrop\" materials could only be consulted \"under certain circumstances.\" 296 F.3d at 52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that time, we did not specify what those limited circumstances might be. However, in <i>Barresi</i> itself, the ALOFAR at issue included claims regarding the right to confront adverse witnesses and due process, both of which are claims that may be grounded either in state law or federal law or both, and cited state court cases that relied upon federal law. <i>Id.</i> at 53-54. Therefore, we found that Barresi's ALOFAR minimally satisfied the exhaustion requirement. As part of the explanation for that conclusion, we noted that the same claims had been raised in the intermediate appellate brief, where Barresi had directly cited federal precedents. <i>Id.</i> at 55-56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have subsequently said that the <i>Barresi</i> backdrop rule applies only in cases where the ALOFAR (or other petition to a state supreme court) was ambiguous about the federal nature of a claim, as it was in <i>Barresi. See Josselyn v. Dennehy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202600\"><a href=\"/opinion/202600/josselyn-v-dennehy/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-4 (1st Cir.2007) (noting that <i>Barresi's</i> \"backdrop\" principle applies when there is ambiguity in the ALOFAR regarding the federal nature of the claim); <i>Goodrich,</i> 448 F.3d at 48 (reviewing the petitioner's lower court briefs as part of the exhaustion analysis, because the ALOFAR relied primarily on state cases, but was somewhat ambiguous about the source of the legal claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this case involves an ALOFAR that was not ambiguous, the <i>Barresi</i> \"backdrop\" principle, assuming it is still valid, provides no assistance to Clements.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1347</span></a></span>, the Court held that, where a federal claim was not included in a petition, the exhaustion analysis could not encompass materials beyond the petition or brief filed with the state's highest court. In that case, the defendant had filed a petition seeking discretionary appellate review by the Oregon Supreme Court and had argued some claims based on federal law and other claims based only on state law. The defendant later filed a habeas petition and argued that at least one of the claims which was presented on state law grounds could be deemed exhausted because a review of the intermediate appellate court opinion showed that he had made federal law arguments on that claim below. Pursuant to Oregon's procedural rules, Oregon's Supreme Court justices had access to the lower court opinions in cases for which a petition was filed, but their rules did not require them to review such opinions. <i>Id.</i> at 31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134723\"><a href=\"/opinion/134723/baldwin-v-reese/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Supreme Court found that burden incompatible with the \"considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.\" <i>Id.</i> at 32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134723\"><a href=\"/opinion/134723/baldwin-v-reese/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1347</span></a></span>. Therefore, the Court held that \"ordinarily a state prisoner does not `fairly present' a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief ... that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material ... that does so.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Barresi</i> approach to the exhaustion analysis may be incompatible with <i>Baldwin. Barresi</i> permits us to consider lower court pleadings or opinions where the state court did not (and was not required to) consider them itself. However, as we have explained, we subsequently limited the <i>Barresi</i> backdrop principle to cases in which there is an ambiguity in the ALOFAR about the federal nature of the claim. Whether <i>Baldwin</i> forecloses consideration of backdrop materials even in cases of ambiguous petitions is a question we need not decide here because Clements' joint venture claim is unmistakably couched only in state law terms. We therefore reserve the issue of the continuing validity of <i>Barresi's</i> backdrop principle for a case in which it is directly raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Massachusetts' Procedural Rules</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements offers an alternative to his <i>Barresi</i> argument in support of his claim that he fairly presented his joint venture claim to the SJC. He argues that Massachusetts Rule of Appellate Procedure (\"MRAP\") 27.1 permits him to rely on the brief that he filed with the Massachusetts Appeals Court to demonstrate the exhaustion of his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MRAP Rule 27.1 says that the full Appeals Court record should be transferred to the SJC after further appellate review is granted. At the time of Clements' appeal, the rule also stated that the SJC appeal would be conducted on the basis of the Appeals Court briefs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See infra</i> note 11 (explaining subsequent alteration of this rule). Clements contends that after further appellate review is granted (regardless of whether it is a limited or general grant<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>), the entire Appeals Court brief is properly \"before\" the SJC, in the same way that the arguments contained in the ALOFAR were before the SJC. He contends that MRAP 27.1 has the effect, therefore, of rendering <i>all</i> the arguments he presented to the lower court exhausted because the SJC was in possession of the full Appeals Court record, including his Appeals Court brief. Citing this \"possession,\" and the provision regarding reliance on the Appeals Court brief, Clements claims that the SJC is actually <i>required</i> by state rules to review the lower court papers. Consequently, he argues, his Appeals Court brief should be treated as a part of the SJC's evaluation of his claim, just as the ALOFAR is so treated, and not as additional or independent backdrop material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements' argument mis-understands the significance of a limited grant of further appellate review. Clements relies on the provision which allows an appeal, after further review has been granted, to be argued on the basis of the Appeals Court brief for his contention that the entire brief (not just the portion relevant to a limited grant) must be reviewed by the SJC. <i>See Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 822 (noting that MRAP 27.1 requires the lower court record to be forwarded to the SJC \"only if &#8212; and <i>after</i> &#8212; it grants an ALOFAR\"). As we have noted, the SJC in this case granted further review on only one issue (the sufficiency claim). Under Massachusetts rules, when the SJC issues a limited grant, it does not decide any issues beyond the one (or ones) granted review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> For this reason, the formal transfer of the Appeals Court record to the SJC does <i>not</i> require the SJC to review briefing or other materials relating to issues beyond the one(s) for which review was granted. Here, the SJC's receipt of the lower court record, including the Appeals Court brief, is relevant only to the one issue (sufficiency of the evidence) on which it exercised its appellate jurisdiction. On the issues for which review was denied, such as the joint venture claim, the physical transfer of the record and the use of the Appeals Court brief for argument on the sufficiency claim are irrelevant to the exhaustion inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find further support for this conclusion in the general principles articulated in <i>Baldwin,</i> 541 U.S. at 31-32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134723\"><a href=\"/opinion/134723/baldwin-v-reese/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1347</span></a></span>. Clements' interpretation of MRAP 27.1 would effectively require the SJC to read and evaluate all of the arguments presented to the lower court after even a limited grant of further review, which is precisely what <i>Baldwin</i> sought to preclude. In claiming that a limited grant of further review places the full record (including both the trial court and appeals court proceedings) before the SJC, and that the exhaustion analysis should encompass that full record, Clements invites the federal habeas court to ignore the state's procedural rules. However, disregarding the difference between a limited grant and a general grant would contravene <i>Baldwin. Baldwin</i> clearly limits the exhaustion analysis to the materials that a state's highest court reviewed while deciding whether to grant a discretionary appeal or evaluating such an appeal on its merits. <i>Id.</i> at 32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134723\"><a href=\"/opinion/134723/baldwin-v-reese/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1347</span></a></span>. Materials that are merely accessible to that court are not to be reviewed in an exhaustion inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under MRAP 27.1, the portion of the Appeals Court brief relating to the joint venture claim was not before the SJC when it reviewed Clements' appeal on the merits. Therefore, our review of the district court's finding that the joint venture claim was not exhausted must be based solely on the contents of the ALOFAR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Exhaustion of the Joint Venture Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements has not sought to persuade us that his ALOFAR described, or even hinted at, a federal basis for his joint venture claim. The ALOFAR's discussion of this claim refers only to state law, and none of the cited state cases relied on federal law. The federal basis for the claim was not presented \"fairly and recognizably,\" <i>Casella,</i> 207 F.3d at 20, nor did Clements articulate a federal law argument \"in such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the federal question,\" <i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 6. Without any references, explicit or implicit, to federal law or principles, the ALOFAR's presentation of the joint venture claim did not apprise the SJC of a possible federal error in the state court's decision. Therefore, we agree with the district court's conclusion that the joint venture claim was not exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Sufficiency Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the joint venture claim, the SJC granted Clements further appellate review for his sufficiency claim. This important fact distinguishes our analysis of this claim from all other claims in this case, as well as the claims discussed in recent cases such as <i>Goodrich,</i> 448 F.3d at 47, and <i>Josselyn,</i> 475 F.3d at 3-4 (where the claims at issue were not even mentioned in the ALOFAR and were deemed abandoned when the ALOFAR was filed with the SJC). The grant of further appellate review is significant, as we have explained, because of the procedural rules in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to a 2001 amendment, MRAP 27.1(f) stated that after further appellate review is granted, a party may elect to proceed with the appeal before the SJC on the basis of the Appeals Court brief previously filed or may petition for permission to submit a new (\"separate or supplemental\") brief. <i>See</i> Mass. R.App. P. Reporter's Notes &#8212; 2001. Clements requested, and was granted, permission to file a new brief. At the time of Clements' appeal, the Massachusetts Rules did not expressly indicate whether the new brief would be considered exclusively or alongside the Appeals Court brief. Because the Rules said that a new brief may be supplemental, we assume here that the SJC reviewed both the Appeals Court brief (on the sufficiency issue <i>only</i>) and the new or supplemental brief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Therefore, we examine the ALOFAR, the \"supplemental\" brief to the SJC, and the relevant portion of the Appeals Court brief &#8212; the materials actually reviewed by the SJC &#8212; to determine whether Clements' sufficiency claim was exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his ALOFAR, relying on Massachusetts cases, Clements urged the SJC to reverse his conviction because the \"inconsistent, recanted, extra judicial grand jury testimony\" tying him to the crime was not corroborated by any more reliable evidence, and therefore was insufficient under <i>Commonwealth v. Daye,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2162882\"><a href=\"/opinion/2162882/commonwealth-v-daye/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2162882\"><a href=\"/opinion/2162882/commonwealth-v-daye/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span> (1984). Clements argues that this claim was exhausted because his Appeals Court brief included a citation to a Supreme Court decision, <i>Barber v. Page,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107668\"><a href=\"/opinion/107668/barber-v-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, 725, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107668\"><a href=\"/opinion/107668/barber-v-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span> (1968), for the simple proposition that the right to confront adverse witnesses is \"a trial right.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find it doubtful that this single cite to a Supreme Court case is enough to satisfy the fair presentation requirement. However, Clements' Appeals Court brief did label this claim as follows: \"The Court violated Clement's rights pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments as well as Article XII of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, when it held at trial and on the motion for a new trial that the jury could consider Willis' grand jury identification as substantive evidence of Clement's [sic] guilt.\" In <i>Baldwin,</i> the Supreme Court found that such labeling of a claim would be enough to satisfy the fair presentation requirement. 541 U.S. at 32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134723\"><a href=\"/opinion/134723/baldwin-v-reese/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1347</span></a></span> (noting that a petitioner who \"wish[es] to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim `federal'\"). Therefore, with this label the sufficiency claim was exhausted, and the district court erred in ruling otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Clements' Four Other Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements' habeas petition included, in addition to the three ALOFAR claims (the joint venture and sufficiency claims discussed above, and the jury hold-out claim found exhausted by the district court), four additional claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Three of these four claims were presented to the Appeals Court, but none were raised before the SJC because they were not mentioned in the ALOFAR.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both <i>Baldwin,</i> 541 U.S. at 32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134723\"><a href=\"/opinion/134723/baldwin-v-reese/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1347</span></a></span>, and <i>Barresi,</i> 296 F.3d at 52 n. 1, explicitly hold that claims omitted from an ALOFAR (or similar petition) are unexhausted. <i>See also Josselyn,</i> 475 F.3d at 3 (\"We observed [in <i>Mele</i>], that finding exhaustion where a claim appeared in the Appeals Court's decision but was omitted from the ALOFAR would unfairly require `the SJC to go over each and every opinion of the [Appeals Court] with a fine tooth comb, in an unremitting search for errors that the parties have neglected to pursue ....'\") (second alteration in original)(quoting <i>Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 823). The district court therefore correctly ruled that these four claims, omitted from the ALOFAR, were not exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Nature of the Remand</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have now determined that, in addition to the jury hold-out claim deemed exhausted by the district court, the sufficiency claim was also exhausted. Clements' habeas petition remains mixed, and he cannot proceed on a mixed petition. <i>See Rose,</i> 455 U.S. at 520-22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110662\"><a href=\"/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span>. Where a petition is deemed mixed, district courts must either dismiss the petition (in compliance with the \"total exhaustion rule\" announced in <i>Rose, id.</i> at 522, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110662\"><a href=\"/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He contends that he filed his ALOFAR while believing that the entire Appeals Court brief would be \"presented to\" the SJC, and thus would be included in the exhaustion analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the four habeas claims omitted entirely from the ALOFAR, the intentional decision to omit some claims from the ALOFAR cannot amount to good cause. We have a long-standing rule that claims ommitted entirely from an ALOFAR cannot be exhausted. <i>See Mele v. Fitchburg Dist. Court,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508417\"><a href=\"/opinion/508417/lane-t-mele-v-fitchburg-district-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 820-23 (1st Cir.1988). Therefore, Clements could not have had good cause for failing to exhaust these claims, and his reliance on the MRAP is irrelevant. <i>See Josselyn v. Dennehy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202600\"><a href=\"/opinion/202600/josselyn-v-dennehy/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2007) (affirming the district court's denial of a stay and abeyance, where petitioner asserted good cause for his failure to exhaust based on counsel's belief that arguments omitted from an ALOFAR might still be exhausted). The district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Clements' decision to omit these claims from his ALOFAR does not amount to good cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements has not presented us with a specific argument about the cause for his failure to exhaust the joint venture claim (which was included in the ALOFAR, but only on state law grounds). As to this claim, he again relies on his more general argument that, based on the MRAP, he and his counsel had a good faith belief that the Appeals Court brief would be \"incorporated\" into the ALOFAR and, thus, included within our exhaustion analysis. Inherent in this argument is the notion that the federal cases cited in the Appeals Court brief in support of the joint venture claim would suffice to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have explained above, <i>see supra</i> Part II.B, the 2001 version of the MRAP did not, as Clements suggests, result in presentation of the <i>full</i> Appeals Court brief to the SJC. His interpretation of the rules was unjustified. To the extent that Clements has also implicitly argued that he relied on the <i>Barresi</i> \"backdrop\" principle in deciding how to articulate the claims within the ALOFAR, we find that argument to be implausible. At the time Clements' ALOFAR was filed, in June 2001, our court had not yet decided <i>Barresi.</i> Therefore, Clements could not have relied on <i>Barresi</i> in his decision to present the joint venture claim only on state grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Moreover, at that time, <i>Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 823, was the guiding precedent in our circuit and it clearly held that federal claims ought to be \"raised within the four corners of the ALOFAR.\" Neither the state rules nor our decisions, then, could have justified Clements' decision to argue the joint venture claim exclusively on state law grounds. He has not shown good cause for his failure to exhaust this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clements' lack of good cause means that, under <i>Rhines,</i> he cannot take advantage of the \"stay and abeyance\" procedure.

We reverse the district court as to Clements' sufficiency claim. His Appeals Court brief, which was properly before the SJC under the 2001 version of MRAP 27.1, satisfied the exhaustion requirement by labeling that claim as federal. The petition is remanded to the district court, so that Clements may decide whether to dismiss his unexhausted claims. We also affirm the district court's denial of a stay of his unexhausted claims pending Clements' return to state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The nine legal claims presented to the Appeals Court were described in some detail by the district court<i>See Clements v.

Therefore, the petition in<i>Baldwin</i> was, in a certain sense, ambiguous, much like the ALOFAR in <i>Barresi,</i> because a reasonable jurist might have concluded that the defendant intended to make state and federal arguments as to both claims, given that they were based on the same legal principle, and that he simply failed to explicitly articulate federal law grounds for the claim concerning appellate counsel.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Massachusetts Rule of Appellate Procedure 27.1 reads in part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Within twenty days after the date of the rescript of the Appeals Court any party to the appeal may file an application for leave to obtain further appellate review of the case by the full Supreme Judicial Court....

It may reject an ALOFAR outright, thereby affirming the Appeals Court decision without further argument or explanation. It may also grant an ALOFAR, thereby exercising its discretionary jurisdiction over the appeal and agreeing to consider all of the legal questions raised in that appeal. Or, the SJC may issue a limited grant in response to an ALOFAR, meaning that it has agreed to consider a single discrete issue (or multiple issues, but fewer than all) on appeal<i>See infra</i> note 10. In this case, the SJC chose the last of these options, and thus reviewed only one of the three issues presented to it in Clements' ALOFAR.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> By contrast, if the SJC issues a general grant of further appellate review, it may review any issue in the case, regardless of whether the appellant specifically raised it in the ALOFAR. In other words, a general grant renders the entire Appeals Court record subject to the SJC's jurisdiction, while a limited grant places only discrete issues within the SJC's jurisdiction<i>See Bradford v.

The title of the brief, as it appeared on the cover page, was \"Brief and Supplemental Record Appendix.\" The government filed a responsive brief, which it titled \"Supplemental Brief.\" We think the labels applied to these briefs are not helpful and we give them no weight. Our assumption is, however, buttressed by a recent change in the Rules. In 2004, the MRAP were modified so that a party who now elects to file a new brief must rely exclusively on that brief; in other words, the current rules require each party to submit to the SJC a single brief, which can be either the Appeals Court brief or (with the SJC's permission) a new brief. Mass. R.App. P. 27.1(f) (2004 Amendment). This change suggests that previously parties were arguing in reliance on both the Appeals Court brief and the \"separate or supplemental\" brief</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Clements' ALOFAR and Supplemental Brief indisputably did not argue this claim on a federal law basis.
