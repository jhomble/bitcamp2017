Lyons with whom Goulston & Storrs was on brief for\npetitioner.\n     Leslie Cayer Ohta, Trial Attorney, with whom Peter D. Keisler,\nAssistant Attorney General, and Mark C. Walters, Assistant\nDirector, were on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                              July 7, 2004\n\f     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.            Petitioner Cherno Jalloh, a\n\ncitizen of Sierra Leone, was admitted to the United States on a\n\nnon-immigrant visa in September 1998.             Eight months later, Jalloh\n\napplied for asylum or, in the alternative, withholding of removal,\n\non the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\npolitical opinion.      An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the petition\n\nand the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed. The IJ relied\n\nheavily on the determination that, as a result of having submitted\n\nfraudulent identity documents, Jalloh was not a credible witness.\n\nThe BIA, although it reversed the adverse credibility finding,\n\nnevertheless adopted the IJ's conclusion that Jalloh failed to\n\ndemonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n      On appeal, Jalloh alleges that the evidence presented below -\n\nparticularly in light of the restoration of credibility - compels\n\na   conclusion   that    he     was    eligible    for   asylum    or,   in   the\n\nalternative, that he is entitled to withholding of removal.                   The\n\nproceedings below, however, leave us without an adequate basis to\n\ndecide whether petitioner's evidence merits denying or granting any\n\nform of relief because the BIA did not fully consider the effect of\n\nthe restoration of credibility on the merits of petitioner's claim\n\nand also assigned him an incorrect burden of proof.                We therefore\n\nvacate   the   BIA's    order    and    remand    for    further   analysis    of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fpetitioner's application in light of his restored credibility and\n\nunder the proper evidentiary standard.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n     Petitioner's application for asylum is predicated on the\n\nbrutal murders of his family and the destruction of the family\n\nhome, allegedly by a rebellious faction of the Sierra Leonean\n\nmilitary.1    The backdrop for this tragedy is the calamitous history\n\nof Sierra Leone, plagued by civil strife since 1991 and beset by\n\nabject poverty for decades prior.        After several years of military\n\nrule, a civilian government was elected in March 1996.             This did\n\nnot end the struggle for power, however, and two formerly warring\n\nfactions - ousted military members known as the Armed Forces\n\nRevolutionary Council (AFRC) and an independent rebel group known\n\nas the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) - cooperated in an effort\n\nto destabilize the elected regime.        The terrorizing of civilians,\n\naimed    at   discouraging   participation    in   and   support   for   the\n\ngovernment, figured prominently in AFRC and RUF tactics.\n\n     Throughout the years of violence, civilians were literally and\n\nfiguratively caught in the crossfire and, as a result, established\n\n\n     1\n      The petitioner's burden for demonstrating eligibility for\nasylum is lower than the burden for withholding of removal. INS v.\nStevic, 467 U.S. 407, 430 (1984); Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365,\n372 (1st Cir. 2003) (observing that \"[b]ecause the 'more likely\nthan not' standard for withholding deportation is more stringent\nthan that for asylum, a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum\nstandard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the former\"). We therefore\nfocus our inquiry on whether the evidence presented by Jalloh meets\nthe lower threshold for asylum.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fmilitia defense forces to protect themselves.          Jalloh's father was\n\na village elder and, although not a member, offered support to one\n\nsuch group known as the Kamajors.2              In addition to offering\n\nprotection, the Kamajors advocated for a democratically elected\n\ngovernment and, after the election in 1996, lent their support to\n\nthe elected civilian government.\n\n       On December 2, 1996, when Jalloh was 22 years of age and a\n\nstudent at the government secondary school in the town of Kenema,\n\nthe school day was interrupted by the sound of gunshots.3          Fleeing\n\nthe building with other students, Jalloh headed towards his home in\n\nhope       of   finding   safety.     Unfortunately,   upon   reaching   his\n\nneighborhood, he discovered that his house had been set on fire and\n\nthat his father, mother, and younger sister had been shot dead.\n\nJalloh found three other bodies, burned beyond recognition, in the\n\nruins of the home and concluded that these were likely three of his\n\nfour remaining siblings.            Jalloh took cover in the home of a\n\nneighbor, Mr. Williams, who said he - Williams - had seen renegade\n\n\n\n       2\n      An elected civilian government was in power at the time\nJalloh's family was killed, but the regime was unstable. In May\n1997 - five months after petitioner's family members were killed -\na military coup succeeded in overthrowing the government. Civilian\nleadership was not re-established until February 1998, and even\nthen fighting continued.\n       3\n      Although the IJ cast doubt on the veracity of the story in\nits entirety, the BIA accepted Jalloh's account of the killings\nwhile finding insufficient evidence that the perpetrators were\npolitically motivated. We therefore recite the course of events as\nrecounted by Jalloh in his brief and his testimony before the IJ.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fsoldiers leaving the Jalloh home. A second man, also sheltering in\n\nWilliams' house but unfamiliar to Jalloh, said that the house of\n\nanother family that supported the Kamajors had also been burned.\n\nJalloh    thus   concluded   that   his   family   had     been   targeted   by\n\ninsurgent forces as a result of his father's support for the\n\nKamajors.\n\n      Fearing that he would suffer a similar fate, he fled to Sierra\n\nLeone's     Waterloo    Displacement   Camp.       After    remaining    there\n\napproximately five months, he came into contact with a former\n\nbusiness partner of his father's, Abdul Traore.            Traore offered to\n\nlet Jalloh live with him in Guinea, and Jalloh agreed, thinking it\n\nsafer than the refugee camp. While in Guinea, however, Jalloh also\n\nvisited a second camp, the Moola Refugee Camp, apparently in order\n\nto   secure   various    identification    documents     pertaining     to   his\n\nalleged refugee status.        In September 1998, Traore and Jalloh\n\ntraveled to the United States.            At Traore's suggestion, Jalloh\n\nfalsely procured a Guinean passport using his own photograph but\n\nthe biographical information of Traore's deceased son.              With this\n\npassport, Jalloh was admitted to the United States on a non-\n\nimmigrant visa. Traore and Jalloh quickly lost contact, and Jalloh\n\nended up in Boston with a friend who knew his family in Sierra\n\nLeone.    In April 1999, Jalloh submitted an application for asylum\n\nand withholding of removal.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f             II.    Applicable Law and Proceedings Below\n\n     In support of his application for asylum, Jalloh was required\n\nto demonstrate that he was a refugee as defined by the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act, namely, that he was unable or unwilling to\n\nreturn to Sierra Leone because of \"persecution or a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"                  8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101 (42)(A).         The regulations place this burden squarely\n\non the asylum applicant.             See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13 (2003).              An\n\napplicant will be deemed to have met this burden if he establishes\n\na well-founded fear of persecution that is both genuine - a\n\nsubjective   inquiry      -    and   reasonable   -   an   objective      standard\n\nrequiring    that   the       applicant   demonstrate      that   there    is   \"a\n\nreasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he or she\n\nwere to return to that country,\" Id. at § 208.13 (b)(2)(B).\n\nSee Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992) (requiring\n\nasylum applicant to show a reasonable fear of persecution \"by\n\ncredible, direct, and specific evidence\").\n\n     We have characterized the appropriate inquiry as \"whether a\n\nreasonable person in the asylum applicant's circumstances would\n\nfear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground,\"\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).                  An alien\n\nneed not provide evidence of being singled out, however, if he or\n\nshe can establish 1) \"a pattern or practice in his or her country\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fof nationality\" of the persecution of similarly situated persons\n\nand 2) \"his or her own inclusion in, and identification with, such\n\ngroup of persons.\"       8 C.F.R. § 208.13 (b)(2)(iii)(A).          See also\n\nKnezevic v. INS, 367 F.3d 1206, 1213 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Kotasz\n\nv. INS, 31 F.3d 847, 852 (9th Cir. 1994)) (asylum applicants not\n\nrequired to demonstrate that they would be \"singled out\" for\n\npersecution because \"'persecution of an entire group can render\n\nproof of individual targeting entirely superfluous'\").\n\n     Significantly, an asylum applicant's testimony alone - if\n\ndeemed credible - could sustain this burden of proof.             8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.13;   Gailius   v.   INS,   147    F.3d   34,    45   (1st   Cir.   1998).\n\nFurthermore, an asylum applicant may establish the persecutor's\n\nmotive through circumstantial evidence.             Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d\n\n11, 15 (1st Cir. 2003); Ramirez Rivas v. INS, 899 F.2d 864, 869\n\n(9th Cir. 1990) (\"Evidence of the motive of a persecutor is hard to\n\ncome by . . . . Circumstantial evidence, of course, is evidence,\n\nnot 'no evidence,' as the Service asserts.\").\n\n     The IJ denied Jalloh's petition on two grounds: first, that he\n\nhad not established that he was a refugee because he could not\n\nprove Sierra Leonean citizenship; second, that Jalloh did not\n\nestablish \"a well-founded fear of persecution because he was not\n\ncredible.\"   Undergirding each of the two grounds was an adverse\n\ncredibility determination stemming from Jalloh's submission of a\n\nfraudulent Sierra Leone identification card as part of his petition\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffor asylum.4          Jalloh claimed that at the time he submitted the\n\ncard, he reasonably believed it to be valid.                   At the hearing before\n\nthe IJ, Jalloh explained that his father had originally secured an\n\nidentification card for him, but that this card was lost.                          Before\n\nhis family's death, Jalloh became concerned about the increasing\n\nviolence around Kenema and wanted to secure a replacement card in\n\ncase he was forced to flee.                 This necessitated a trip to Freetown,\n\nSierra      Leone's        capitol.         Because    ambushes    of    travelers      were\n\nfrequent, Jalloh paid someone to take the trip for him, and thus\n\nacquired his second card through this intermediary.                         He testified\n\nthat       he   had   no    reason     to    believe    that   the      second   card    was\n\nfraudulent because it looked like all other identity cards he had\n\nseen.\n\n       The IJ, however, was not convinced, and, relying on Matter of\n\nO-D, 21 I&N Dec. 1079, 1083 (BIA 1998), noted that submission of at\n\nleast one counterfeit identification document \"generally discredits\n\n[petitioner's]             testimony        regarding     asylum     eligibility        and\n\nspecifically discredits his identity claim.\"                            The IJ not only\n\ndiscounted Jalloh's testimony, but also accorded very little weight\n\nto expert testimony that supported his claim of citizenship,\n\nnamely, that Jalloh was fluent in languages native to Sierra Leone\n\n\n       4\n      Jalloh does not contest the testimony of a forensic analyst\nwho concluded that the card was \"concocted.\" On this basis, the IJ\nconcluded that Jalloh's claim of Sierra Leonean citizenship was not\ncredible, and thus he could not establish a foundation for refugee\nstatus.\n\n                                              -8-\n\fand was familiar with the culture generally and people specifically\n\nin a manner to be expected of a native.\n\n     The alternative ground for denying asylum - that Jalloh did\n\nnot establish a well-founded fear of persecution because he did not\n\ndemonstrate a causal connection between his family's political\n\nopinion and the feared persecution - also relied in part on the\n\nadverse credibility finding.    In evaluating Jalloh's claim that\n\ninsurgent forces were aware of his father's support of the Kamajors\n\nand thus targeted the family on account of political affiliation,\n\nthe IJ again discounted Jalloh's testimony because he was not a\n\ncredible witness and \"therefore, his testimony as to what actually\n\noccurred is questionable at best.\"    The court instead adopted the\n\ngovernment's argument that Jalloh's family simply fell victim to\n\nthe indiscriminate violence sweeping through the country.\n\n     The BIA, on the other hand, accepted Jalloh's explanation of\n\nthe lost identification card and thus credited Jalloh's claim of\n\ncitizenship.5   The BIA noted more generally that \"[t]he submission\n\nof the fraudulent document does not taint the respondent's veracity\n\nand credibility under Matter of O-D . . . because the respondent\n\ntestified that he did not know the document was fraudulent.\"    By\n\nvirtue of its citation to Matter of O-D, it appears that the BIA\n\nmay have intended the credibility reversal to affect not just the\n\n\n     5\n      As a further result of the restoration of credibility, the\nBIA reversed the IJ's finding that Jalloh had filed a frivolous\napplication for asylum.\n\n                                -9-\n\fclaim of citizenship, but \"overall credibility\" as well.6 However,\n\nin reviewing the IJ's alternative ground for dismissal, the BIA did\n\nnot address Jalloh's evidence - or the IJ's treatment of that\n\nevidence - in light of Jalloh's restored credibility.            On the key\n\nissue of whether the family's murders had been on account of\n\npolitical opinion, the BIA offered a cursory review of the evidence\n\nas interpreted by the IJ and then concluded that Jalloh's claim of\n\ncausation was simply \"speculation.\"\n\n                             III.    Analysis\n\n   We review the BIA's decision under a \"substantial evidence\"\n\nstandard.    Guzman,   327   F.3d   at     15.   Under   this   deferential\n\nstandard, we will uphold the BIA if the decision is \"supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"      Id. (citing INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502\n\nU.S. 478, 481 (1992)).       We will not reverse unless we determine\n\nthat the record compels the conclusion that Jalloh is eligible for\n\nasylum.   Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 565.        We may remand, however,\n\nif the BIA's opinion fails to state \"with sufficient particularity\n\nand clarity the reasons for denial of asylum.\"           Gailius, 147 F.3d\n\nat 46 (citing Hartooni v. INS, 21 F.3d 336, 343 (9th Cir. 1994)\n\n(internal citations omitted)).\n\n\n     6\n      Indeed, in Matter of O-D, not only had false documents been\npresented, but, as the BIA stated, \"[I]n the absence of an\nexplanation regarding such presentation, [the presentation] creates\nserious doubts regarding the respondent's overall credibility.\"\nMatter of O-D, 21 I&N Dec. at 1083.\n\n                                    -10-\n\f     At the outset, we note that when the BIA required Jalloh to\n\nprove a well-founded fear of persecution by showing that it was\n\n\"more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened\n\nupon return to Sierra Leone,\" the BIA assigned Jalloh the wrong\n\nburden of proof.7   The \"more likely than not\" burden applies to\n\nwithholding of removal, 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2)(ii), not asylum,\n\nwhich requires a lesser showing that the \"fear of persecution upon\n\nreturn is reasonable,\"8 Id. at § 208.13(b)(2)(iii)(B) (emphasis\n\nadded).   Compare INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 449 (1987)\n\n(describing as \"inexorable\" the conclusion that \"to show a 'well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution,' an alien need not prove that it is\n\nmore likely than not that he or she will be persecuted in his or\n\nher home country\"), with INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 430 (1984)\n\n(requiring that an applicant for withholding of removal demonstrate\n\n\n\n     7\n      Jalloh did not raise this issue on appeal, and the government\ndid not acknowledge the misstep, but it is settled in this circuit\nthat an appellate court has discretion, in exceptional cases, to\nrelieve a party of forfeiture. See United States v. La Guardia,\n902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir. 1990).       The BIA's error of law\ndeviates from clear precedent of both the Supreme Court and this\ncircuit and, therefore, should not escape our attention,\nparticularly in a case where further proceedings will be necessary\non remand.\n     8\n      The confusion is further apparent in the BIA's conclusion\nthat Jalloh \"failed to prove entitlement to asylum.\"       As the\nSupreme Court explained in INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421,\n441 (1987), asylum is discretionary relief and thus an applicant\nwho demonstrates a well-founded fear of persecution is simply\ndeemed \"eligible\" for asylum.   An applicant who meets the higher\nstandard for withholding of removal, however, is \"entitled\" to\nrelief.\n\n                               -11-\n\f\"that it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to\n\npersecution on one of the specified grounds,\" but specifically\n\nleaving open the required showing for an asylum applicant).   This\n\nlegal error adds to the difficulty of reviewing the BIA's decision.\n\nThe Board erroneously failed to consider whether Jalloh's evidence\n\nsupports a reasonable fear of persecution sufficient to sustain an\n\napplication for asylum, even if it does not demonstrate that\n\nJalloh's likelihood of facing persecution is \"more likely than\n\nnot.\"    See Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft, --- F.3d ---, --- (1st\n\nCir. 2004) [No. 02-2513, slip op. at 27] (cautioning that the \"INS\n\ncannot impose an evidentiary burden on the applicant that is not\n\nprovided by and appears to be inconsistent with the statute or\n\nregulation\") (internal citations omitted).   Moreover, despite its\n\nrestoration of credibility to Jalloh, the BIA gave short shrift to\n\nhis considerable evidence that he faced a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of political opinion.9\n\n     Jalloh presented probative evidence that suggested a political\n\nconnection between the violence suffered by his family and his\n\nfather's political views.   His own testimony described how a known\n\nmember of the Kamajors would visit the family home - located in a\n\n\n     9\n      Jalloh's claim is actually based on his fear that the\nrenegade soldiers and insurgents would impute his father's\npolitical support of the Kamajors to Jalloh himself, and thus\ntarget him for persecution. Such imputed political opinion - even\nif incorrectly attributed to the asylum applicant - can satisfy the\n\"on account of\" requirement under the Act's definition of a\nrefugee. Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 331 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                               -12-\n\fsection    of   the    town    controlled       by    the    renegade   soldiers     -\n\napproximately twice each month to arrange for supplies of rice -\n\npaid for by Jalloh's father - to be picked up at various local\n\nstores.     Jalloh explained that his father was a member of the\n\nvillage elders and that as a leader in the community, his political\n\nopinions - including his support of free elections and the Kamajors\n\n- would have been known.\n\n     Jalloh also testified to having been told that on the day his\n\nhome was destroyed, the home of another family, known to have\n\nsupported    the   Kamajors,      was    also    burned.        Such    evidence    of\n\nselectivity further buttresses Jalloh's claim that his family was\n\ntargeted on account of political opinion.                   See Popova v.

Pieterson v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 38, 42-\n\n43 (1st Cir. 2004) (justifying denial of petitioner's claim in part\n\non the fact that the evidence \"suggested that no particular group\n\nof persons was being singled out; the looting and burning of houses\n\nand shops did not target persons of particular ethnicities or\n\npolitical beliefs\") (emphasis added).\n\n     Documentary evidence in the form of news reports and country\n\nprofiles    from      the     United    States       Department    of    State     and\n\norganizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\ffurther   substantiates    Jalloh's     claim    that    supporters   of   the\n\nKamajors were targeted for persecution.             Although the reports\n\nattest to the generalized violence characteristic of Sierra Leone's\n\ncivil war and aftermath, there is also clear mention of attacks on\n\nKamajors and purported collaborators in Kenema, the same city in\n\nwhich Jalloh's family lived.        Significantly, the reported abuses\n\nwere not confined solely to suspected members of the Kamajors, but\n\nalso extended to citizens accused of simply supporting the group.\n\nFinally, Professor Rosalind Shaw, accepted by the IJ as an expert\n\non the conditions of Sierra Leone, testified that both Jalloh's\n\naccount   of   the    killings   and   the    targeted   abuse   of   Kamajor\n\nsupporters are consistent with her understanding of the pervasive\n\nsituation in the country.\n\n     In   addition,    Jalloh    provided    evidence    pertaining   to   the\n\nlikelihood of his being identified and targeted for persecution\n\nshould he return to Sierra Leone.            He testified that he knew at\n\nleast twenty young men from school and from playing soccer who\n\njoined the soldiers, and he explained that these men would not only\n\nbe able to identify him, but would also be aware of his family's\n\npolitical affiliation.     Jalloh's own testimony was corroborated by\n\nthat of Professor Shaw, who offered her expert opinion that should\n\nJalloh return to Sierra Leone, he was \"more than likely\" to be\n\nidentified and persecuted.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f     The BIA acknowledged that the record contained evidence that\n\n\"soldiers targeted Kamajors and supporters of Kamajors, and that\n\nthe respondent's father was a supporter of the Kamajors,\" but then\n\ndismissed Jalloh's claim that his family had been killed on account\n\nof political opinion as \"speculation.\" This cursory discounting of\n\nJalloh's proffered testimony is - absent further explanation -\n\ninconsistent both with the BIA's determination that Jalloh was a\n\ncredible witness and 8 C.F.R. § 208.13, which allows an applicant\n\nto prove motivation on his or her own testimony alone, absent other\n\nevidence to the contrary.   See Shoafera v. INS, 228 F.3d 1070, 1075\n\n(9th Cir. 2000) (\"A bald assertion that [petitioner's] credible\n\ntestimony was 'speculation' is insufficient.      Some evidence or\n\nsupport for that conclusion must be offered.\").    Although we have\n\nclarified that a reviewing court need not accept the uncontradicted\n\ntestimony of an asylum applicant as true if it is \"internally\n\ninconsistent or belied by the prevailing circumstances,\" Aguilar-\n\nSolis, 168 F.3d at 570, the BIA has given us no indication that\n\neither of those qualifying characteristics is present here.     The\n\nonly analysis offered by the BIA was that \"there is no evidence\n\nthat the respondent's father was ever threatened or harmed on\n\naccount of his political beliefs . . . or that other members of his\n\nfamily had been threatened or harmed.\"        This, however, is a\n\nconclusory characterization of the record which, as we have noted,\n\nis too opaque to serve as the basis for decision.\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f     Jalloh has offered evidence - his own testimony, international\n\nand governmental agency reports, and expert opinion - that his\n\nfamily was killed on account of his father's political affiliation\n\nwith the Kamajors and that, furthermore, should he return to Sierra\n\nLeone, he may suffer a similar fate.   Because the BIA reversed the\n\nIJ with respect to Jalloh's credibility, we need a more detailed\n\nexplanation of why this evidence is insufficient.     Gailius, 147\n\nF.3d at 47 (explaining that remand is appropriate in asylum context\n\nwhen \"a reviewing court cannot sustain the agency's decision\n\nbecause it has failed to offer legally sufficient reasons for its\n\ndecision\").\n\n     The combined effect of the credibility reversal and the\n\nassignment of the wrong burden of proof has left us without a\n\nsufficient basis to affirm the BIA, and we therefore vacate the\n\norder of the BIA and remand to determine whether the credible\n\ntestimony offered by Jalloh establishes past persecution or a\n\nreasonable fear of future persecution on account of political\n\nopinion.\n\nVacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

Petitioner Cherno Jalloh, a\n\ncitizen of Sierra Leone, was admitted to the United States on a\n\nnon-immigrant visa in September 1998.             Eight months later, Jalloh\n\napplied for asylum or, in the alternative, withholding of removal,\n\non the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\npolitical opinion.      An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the petition\n\nand the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed. The IJ relied\n\nheavily on the determination that, as a result of having submitted\n\nfraudulent identity documents, Jalloh was not a credible witness.\n\nThe BIA, although it reversed the adverse credibility finding,\n\nnevertheless adopted the IJ's conclusion that Jalloh failed to\n\ndemonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n      On appeal, Jalloh alleges that the evidence presented below -\n\nparticularly in light of the restoration of credibility - compels\n\na   conclusion   that    he     was    eligible    for   asylum    or,   in   the\n\nalternative, that he is entitled to withholding of removal.                   The\n\nproceedings below, however, leave us without an adequate basis to\n\ndecide whether petitioner's evidence merits denying or granting any\n\nform of relief because the BIA did not fully consider the effect of\n\nthe restoration of credibility on the merits of petitioner's claim\n\nand also assigned him an incorrect burden of proof.                We therefore\n\nvacate   the   BIA's    order    and    remand    for    further   analysis    of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fpetitioner's application in light of his restored credibility and\n\nunder the proper evidentiary standard.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n     Petitioner's application for asylum is predicated on the\n\nbrutal murders of his family and the destruction of the family\n\nhome, allegedly by a rebellious faction of the Sierra Leonean\n\nmilitary.1    The backdrop for this tragedy is the calamitous history\n\nof Sierra Leone, plagued by civil strife since 1991 and beset by\n\nabject poverty for decades prior.        After several years of military\n\nrule, a civilian government was elected in March 1996.             This did\n\nnot end the struggle for power, however, and two formerly warring\n\nfactions - ousted military members known as the Armed Forces\n\nRevolutionary Council (AFRC) and an independent rebel group known\n\nas the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) - cooperated in an effort\n\nto destabilize the elected regime.        The terrorizing of civilians,\n\naimed    at   discouraging   participation    in   and   support   for   the\n\ngovernment, figured prominently in AFRC and RUF tactics.\n\n     Throughout the years of violence, civilians were literally and\n\nfiguratively caught in the crossfire and, as a result, established\n\n\n     1\n      The petitioner's burden for demonstrating eligibility for\nasylum is lower than the burden for withholding of removal.

We therefore\nfocus our inquiry on whether the evidence presented by Jalloh meets\nthe lower threshold for asylum.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fmilitia defense forces to protect themselves.          Jalloh's father was\n\na village elder and, although not a member, offered support to one\n\nsuch group known as the Kamajors.2              In addition to offering\n\nprotection, the Kamajors advocated for a democratically elected\n\ngovernment and, after the election in 1996, lent their support to\n\nthe elected civilian government.\n\n       On December 2, 1996, when Jalloh was 22 years of age and a\n\nstudent at the government secondary school in the town of Kenema,\n\nthe school day was interrupted by the sound of gunshots.3          Fleeing\n\nthe building with other students, Jalloh headed towards his home in\n\nhope       of   finding   safety.     Unfortunately,   upon   reaching   his\n\nneighborhood, he discovered that his house had been set on fire and\n\nthat his father, mother, and younger sister had been shot dead.\n\nJalloh found three other bodies, burned beyond recognition, in the\n\nruins of the home and concluded that these were likely three of his\n\nfour remaining siblings.            Jalloh took cover in the home of a\n\nneighbor, Mr. Williams, who said he - Williams - had seen renegade\n\n\n\n       2\n      An elected civilian government was in power at the time\nJalloh's family was killed, but the regime was unstable. In May\n1997 - five months after petitioner's family members were killed -\na military coup succeeded in overthrowing the government. Civilian\nleadership was not re-established until February 1998, and even\nthen fighting continued.\n       3\n      Although the IJ cast doubt on the veracity of the story in\nits entirety, the BIA accepted Jalloh's account of the killings\nwhile finding insufficient evidence that the perpetrators were\npolitically motivated. We therefore recite the course of events as\nrecounted by Jalloh in his brief and his testimony before the IJ.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fsoldiers leaving the Jalloh home. A second man, also sheltering in\n\nWilliams' house but unfamiliar to Jalloh, said that the house of\n\nanother family that supported the Kamajors had also been burned.\n\nJalloh    thus   concluded   that   his   family   had     been   targeted   by\n\ninsurgent forces as a result of his father's support for the\n\nKamajors.\n\n      Fearing that he would suffer a similar fate, he fled to Sierra\n\nLeone's     Waterloo    Displacement   Camp.       After    remaining    there\n\napproximately five months, he came into contact with a former\n\nbusiness partner of his father's, Abdul Traore.            Traore offered to\n\nlet Jalloh live with him in Guinea, and Jalloh agreed, thinking it\n\nsafer than the refugee camp. While in Guinea, however, Jalloh also\n\nvisited a second camp, the Moola Refugee Camp, apparently in order\n\nto   secure   various    identification    documents     pertaining     to   his\n\nalleged refugee status.        In September 1998, Traore and Jalloh\n\ntraveled to the United States.            At Traore's suggestion, Jalloh\n\nfalsely procured a Guinean passport using his own photograph but\n\nthe biographical information of Traore's deceased son.              With this\n\npassport, Jalloh was admitted to the United States on a non-\n\nimmigrant visa. Traore and Jalloh quickly lost contact, and Jalloh\n\nended up in Boston with a friend who knew his family in Sierra\n\nLeone.    In April 1999, Jalloh submitted an application for asylum\n\nand withholding of removal.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f             II.    Applicable Law and Proceedings Below\n\n     In support of his application for asylum, Jalloh was required\n\nto demonstrate that he was a refugee as defined by the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act, namely, that he was unable or unwilling to\n\nreturn to Sierra Leone because of \"persecution or a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"                  8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101 (42)(A).

At the hearing before\n\nthe IJ, Jalloh explained that his father had originally secured an\n\nidentification card for him, but that this card was lost.                          Before\n\nhis family's death, Jalloh became concerned about the increasing\n\nviolence around Kenema and wanted to secure a replacement card in\n\ncase he was forced to flee.                 This necessitated a trip to Freetown,\n\nSierra      Leone's        capitol.         Because    ambushes    of    travelers      were\n\nfrequent, Jalloh paid someone to take the trip for him, and thus\n\nacquired his second card through this intermediary.                         He testified\n\nthat       he   had   no    reason     to    believe    that   the      second   card    was\n\nfraudulent because it looked like all other identity cards he had\n\nseen.\n\n       The IJ, however, was not convinced, and, relying on Matter of\n\nO-D, 21 I&N Dec. 1079, 1083 (BIA 1998), noted that submission of at\n\nleast one counterfeit identification document \"generally discredits\n\n[petitioner's]             testimony        regarding     asylum     eligibility        and\n\nspecifically discredits his identity claim.\"                            The IJ not only\n\ndiscounted Jalloh's testimony, but also accorded very little weight\n\nto expert testimony that supported his claim of citizenship,\n\nnamely, that Jalloh was fluent in languages native to Sierra Leone\n\n\n       4\n      Jalloh does not contest the testimony of a forensic analyst\nwho concluded that the card was \"concocted.\" On this basis, the IJ\nconcluded that Jalloh's claim of Sierra Leonean citizenship was not\ncredible, and thus he could not establish a foundation for refugee\nstatus.\n\n                                              -8-\n\fand was familiar with the culture generally and people specifically\n\nin a manner to be expected of a native.\n\n     The alternative ground for denying asylum - that Jalloh did\n\nnot establish a well-founded fear of persecution because he did not\n\ndemonstrate a causal connection between his family's political\n\nopinion and the feared persecution - also relied in part on the\n\nadverse credibility finding.    In evaluating Jalloh's claim that\n\ninsurgent forces were aware of his father's support of the Kamajors\n\nand thus targeted the family on account of political affiliation,\n\nthe IJ again discounted Jalloh's testimony because he was not a\n\ncredible witness and \"therefore, his testimony as to what actually\n\noccurred is questionable at best.\"    The court instead adopted the\n\ngovernment's argument that Jalloh's family simply fell victim to\n\nthe indiscriminate violence sweeping through the country.\n\n     The BIA, on the other hand, accepted Jalloh's explanation of\n\nthe lost identification card and thus credited Jalloh's claim of\n\ncitizenship.5   The BIA noted more generally that \"[t]he submission\n\nof the fraudulent document does not taint the respondent's veracity\n\nand credibility under Matter of O-D . . . because the respondent\n\ntestified that he did not know the document was fraudulent.\"    By\n\nvirtue of its citation to Matter of O-D, it appears that the BIA\n\nmay have intended the credibility reversal to affect not just the\n\n\n     5\n      As a further result of the restoration of credibility, the\nBIA reversed the IJ's finding that Jalloh had filed a frivolous\napplication for asylum.\n\n                                -9-\n\fclaim of citizenship, but \"overall credibility\" as well.6 However,\n\nin reviewing the IJ's alternative ground for dismissal, the BIA did\n\nnot address Jalloh's evidence - or the IJ's treatment of that\n\nevidence - in light of Jalloh's restored credibility.            On the key\n\nissue of whether the family's murders had been on account of\n\npolitical opinion, the BIA offered a cursory review of the evidence\n\nas interpreted by the IJ and then concluded that Jalloh's claim of\n\ncausation was simply \"speculation.\"\n\n                             III.

This\n\nlegal error adds to the difficulty of reviewing the BIA's decision.\n\nThe Board erroneously failed to consider whether Jalloh's evidence\n\nsupports a reasonable fear of persecution sufficient to sustain an\n\napplication for asylum, even if it does not demonstrate that\n\nJalloh's likelihood of facing persecution is \"more likely than\n\nnot.\"    See Hernandez-Barrera v.

Moreover, despite its\n\nrestoration of credibility to Jalloh, the BIA gave short shrift to\n\nhis considerable evidence that he faced a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of political opinion.9\n\n     Jalloh presented probative evidence that suggested a political\n\nconnection between the violence suffered by his family and his\n\nfather's political views.   His own testimony described how a known\n\nmember of the Kamajors would visit the family home - located in a\n\n\n     9\n      Jalloh's claim is actually based on his fear that the\nrenegade soldiers and insurgents would impute his father's\npolitical support of the Kamajors to Jalloh himself, and thus\ntarget him for persecution.

Significantly, the reported abuses\n\nwere not confined solely to suspected members of the Kamajors, but\n\nalso extended to citizens accused of simply supporting the group.\n\nFinally, Professor Rosalind Shaw, accepted by the IJ as an expert\n\non the conditions of Sierra Leone, testified that both Jalloh's\n\naccount   of   the    killings   and   the    targeted   abuse   of   Kamajor\n\nsupporters are consistent with her understanding of the pervasive\n\nsituation in the country.\n\n     In   addition,    Jalloh    provided    evidence    pertaining   to   the\n\nlikelihood of his being identified and targeted for persecution\n\nshould he return to Sierra Leone.            He testified that he knew at\n\nleast twenty young men from school and from playing soccer who\n\njoined the soldiers, and he explained that these men would not only\n\nbe able to identify him, but would also be aware of his family's\n\npolitical affiliation.     Jalloh's own testimony was corroborated by\n\nthat of Professor Shaw, who offered her expert opinion that should\n\nJalloh return to Sierra Leone, he was \"more than likely\" to be\n\nidentified and persecuted.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f     The BIA acknowledged that the record contained evidence that\n\n\"soldiers targeted Kamajors and supporters of Kamajors, and that\n\nthe respondent's father was a supporter of the Kamajors,\" but then\n\ndismissed Jalloh's claim that his family had been killed on account\n\nof political opinion as \"speculation.\" This cursory discounting of\n\nJalloh's proffered testimony is - absent further explanation -\n\ninconsistent both with the BIA's determination that Jalloh was a\n\ncredible witness and 8 C.F.R. § 208.13, which allows an applicant\n\nto prove motivation on his or her own testimony alone, absent other\n\nevidence to the contrary.
