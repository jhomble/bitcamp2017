See, e.g., In re\n                                                                 \n\nSan Juan Dupont  Plaza Hotel Fire  Litig., 989  F.2d 36, 38  (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1993).  So it is here.  We agree  with the court below that,\n\nin this case, (i) the mortgage at issue is not a valid \"in globo\"\n\nmortgage under Louisiana law, and (ii) the bankruptcy court erred\n\nin holding to the contrary.   We, therefore, summarily affirm the\n\njudgment  below, for substantially the reasons articulated in the\n\ndistrict court's comprehensive and well-reasoned rescript, see In\n                                                                 \n\nre  Microbiological Sciences, Inc.,  C.A.
