Alan  and  Harriet  Lewis\n                              \n\nappeal  from  a  Tax  Court decision  assessing  taxes  upon\n\n$1,062,500,  which  a  Lewis-controlled  corporation  called\n\n\"ILT\"  distributed to  the  Lewises in  1984.   In  the  Tax\n\nCourt's view, that money represented an ILT \"dividend,\" paid\n\nto  the Lewises at that time.   See I.R.C.   301(a), (c)(1)-\n                                   \n\n(3)  (1986).  The  Lewises disagree.  They  point out that a\n\n\"dividend\"  must  come from  a  corporation's \"earnings  and\n\nprofits.\"   See id.   316(a).   And, they argue,  ILT had no\n                  \n\n\"earnings and profits,\" either in or before 1984, from which\n\nit might  have paid a \"dividend\"  in 1984.   The Tax Court's\n\ncontrary conclusion, they believe,  rests upon a simple, and\n\nclear, factual error.\n              \n\n          The  Lewises   further   argue  that,   if   ILT's\n\ndistribution of the $1,062,500 is not a dividend, neither is\n\nit any  other kind of 1984  taxable \"income.\"  See  id.   61\n                                                      \n\n(defining \"gross income\" as \"all income from whatever source\n\nderived\").   Rather,  in their  view, the  1984 distribution\n\nrepresents income that they constructively  received in, and\n\naccumulated from, earlier years,  namely from the years 1974\n\nthrough 1980.   The  Lewises concede  that they  should have\n                                                            \n\npaid (but never have paid) income tax on this money sometime\n                         \n\nbetween 1974 and  1981.   But, as all  parties concede,  the\n                                     \n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nstatute  of  limitations  now  bars  the  Commissioner  from\n\nassessing  taxes  for those  earlier  years.    And, in  the\n\nLewises's view, the Commissioner  cannot subvert the letter,\n\nand  the spirit, of that  statute by taxing  now income that\n                                                \n\nthe  government  should  have  taxed then.      The  Lewises\n                                         \n\nconclude that  we should, therefore, simply  reverse the Tax\n\nCourt's determination.\n\n          In our view, the Lewises are correct about the Tax\n\nCourt's factual error.  The record makes clear that the 1984\n\ndistribution did not come from ILT's \"earnings and profits.\"\n\nIt is, as the  Lewises say, some form of  accumulated income\n\nthat  the  Lewises \"constructively  received\" in  prior, and\n\nnow-closed, tax years.  But, whether or not the Lewises must\n\npay  taxes on that distribution  is a different  matter.  In\n\nadjudicating tax cases, the courts have developed a  type of\n\nestoppel  known   as  \"quasi  estoppel\"  or   the  \"duty  of\n\nconsistency,\" whereby a taxpayer may not take  a position in\n\none year to  his advantage,  and then at  some later  point,\n\nafter correction for that  year is barred by the  statute of\n\nlimitations, adopt a contrary  position touching on the same\n\nfacts  or  transaction.   Jacob  Mertens,  Jr., The  Law  of\n                                                            \n\nFederal  Income  Taxation     60.05 (1992).    Whether  that\n                         \n\ndoctrine  requires  the  Lewises   to  treat  the  1984  ILT\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\ndistribution as taxable income is a  matter so far addressed\n\nonly superficially by the parties and upon which we wish the\n\nTax  Court's  views.   We  therefore  decline the  Lewises's\n\ninvitation  to hold  that the $1,062,500  is not  taxable to\n\nthem in 1984, and we  remand this case to the Tax  Court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                             I\n\n                      Background Facts\n                                      \n\n          To understand the Tax  Court's factual error,  one\n\nmust have in mind a rather complex (and here undisputed) set\n\nof events,  some  of which  took  place before,  and  others\n\nafter, December 1980, when ILT's  bank account showed a zero\n\nbalance.\n\n                             A\n\n                    Before December 1980\n                                        \n\n          This  case arises out of  an effort by Alan Lewis,\n\nand Steven  Belkin, his business associate,  to avoid paying\n\nfederal  income  taxes  on revenue  generated  primarily  in\n\nEurope  by  their  travel  business, Trans  National  Travel\n\n(\"TNT\").   Two key sets of events took place before December\n\n1980.   First, between 1974  and 1980, Lewis  and Belkin had\n\nTNT employees  send TNT  revenue  generated by  the sale  of\n\nlocal (e.g.,  European city) tours  in Europe to  the Cayman\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nIsland bank account of ILT, a  foreign corporation that they\n\nowned and  controlled.   ILT transferred some  of the  money\n                                             \n\nreceived  from  TNT to  two  Cayman  Island trusts.    Those\n\ntrusts, it later turned out, were \"grantor\" trusts of  Lewis\n\nand Belkin (meaning, basically, that Lewis and Belkin should\n\nhave paid income tax on the money those trusts received when\n\nthe trusts received it.)\n\n          Second,  and more important  for present purposes,\n\nbetween 1977 and  1980 ILT  \"loaned\" the rest  of the  money\n                                             \n\nreceived  from TNT  to two  limited partnerships  formed and\n\ncontrolled by Lewis and  Belkin.  In effect, this  was money\n\n\"loaned\" by Lewis and Belkin  to themselves, for the purpose\n\nof making some  personal investments.   The total amount  of\n\nthese \"loans\" was approximately  $2.075 million.  There were\n\nthree  such  \"loans,\"  each  of which  involved  money  that\n\ntravelled  a circuitous  path,  reaching  Lewis  and  Belkin\n\nthrough paper intermediaries:\n\n          a)   In 1977, ILT loaned $800,000 to Gran Compania\n               De  Comercio,  which  reloaned  the  money to\n               Windikip    Financieringsmaatschappij   B.V.,\n               which   in  turn   reloaned   the  money   to\n               Charlesgate West Associates.  We  assume that\n               Gran Compania and Windikip were Lewis/Belkin-\n               controlled  entities  that  existed  only  on\n               paper (though their use  may have avoided the\n               need  to  withhold  U.S.  taxes  on  interest\n               payments).    Charlesgate was  a Lewis/Belkin\n               real estate partnership, which used the money\n               for the benefit of Lewis and Belkin.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n          b)   In   1978,   ILT   loaned  Charlesgate   West\n               Associates an additional $600,000,  using the\n               same intermediaries.\n\n          c)   In   1980,   ILT   loaned   $675,000   to   a\n               Lewis/Belkin-controlled      real      estate\n               partnership    named     Taunton    Boulevard\n               Associates,  which used  the money  for their\n               benefit.    This   time  the   intermediaries\n               consisted of two  different foreign  entities\n               called  \"Mido  Capital  Venture,   N.V.\"  and\n               \"Bristol Realty Trust.\"\n\n          In each  instance, the lending entity  and all the\n\nborrowing  entities created  all the  necessary loan-related\n\ndocumentation.  Thus, on paper, it  seemed as if Charlesgate\n\nowed  Windikip (which  owed Gran  Compania, which  owed ILT)\n\nregular payments of  interest plus  repayment of  principal.\n\nSimilarly, it  seemed, on paper, as if  Taunton owed Bristol\n\n(which  owed  Mido,  which  owed ILT)  regular  payments  of\n\ninterest plus repayment of principal.  The Tax  Court found,\n\nhowever,  that  neither Lewis  nor  Belkin,  the persons  in\n\ncontrol of Charlesgate and Taunton Associates, ever intended\n\nto  pay back the  $2.075 million in \"loans\"  to ILT.  Hence,\n\nfor tax purposes, they were not loans at all.\n\n          By  the end of  1980, ILT apparently  had paid out\n\nall  the  TNT  money  it  had  received  either  1)  to  the\n\nLewis/Belkin \"grantor\"  trusts, or  2)  to the  Lewis/Belkin\n\nreal  estate  partnerships  by  way of  the  $2.075  million\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nCharlesgate and Taunton  loans.   As we have  said, the  Tax\n\nCourt  found  that, as  of  December  31,  1980, ILT's  bank\n\nbalance was zero.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n                             B\n\n                         After 1980\n                                   \n\n          Three  significant  events  occurred  after  1980.\n\nFirst,  in  1983,  Belkin  and Lewis  ended  their  business\n\nassociation.  As part of  their consequent efforts to divide\n\nproperty jointly owned or  controlled, they decided to repay\n\nthe three  \"loans\" from  ILT.   They therefore reversed  the\n\n\"money flow,\" having (in the  one case) Gran Compania  (paid\n\nby Windikip,  paid by Charlesgate) pay ILT $1.4 million, and\n\n(in the other  case) Mido Capital  (paid by Bristol  Realty,\n\npaid by Taunton) pay ILT $708,658.\n\n          Second,  ILT,  having  received this  money  (plus\n\nrelated interest) from Gran Compania and Mido, divided it in\n\nhalf,  distributing $1,079,329  to Belkin's  \"grantor\" trust\n\nand  $1,079,329 to  Lewis's \"grantor\"  trust.   The adjusted\n\namount   ($1,062,500)  of   this  distribution   to  Lewis's\n\n\"grantor\" trust in 1984 (which, as noted  above, amounts for\n\ntax purposes  to a  distribution to  Lewis  himself) is  the\n\nmoney at issue here.\n\n                             II\n\n                   The Tax Court's Error\n                                        \n\n          The  factual record,  as just  described, suggests\n\nthat  the underlying,  and possibly  difficult,  question in\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nthis case is  not one of finding the facts,  but rather, one\n\nof characterizing facts that are essentially beyond dispute.\n                 \n\nIs ILT's 1984 distribution of roughly $2.159 million taxable\n\n\"income\"  to its recipients in  light of the  fact that that\n\ndistribution originated in the repayment of sham loans (made\n                       \n\nin years now closed to review), the funds for which \"loans,\"\n\nin  turn, originally  took the  form of  what may  have been\n\ntaxable  (but  untaxed)  income  to  those  same  recipients\n\n(again, in  years now  closed to  review)?    The  Tax Court\n\navoided this question, however, by finding  as fact that ILT\n\nhad other  \"earnings  and profits\"  out  of which  its  1984\n         \n\ndistribution could have been made.  The Tax Court found that\n\n          between  1981   and  1984,  unidentified\n          amounts   were  deposited   into  and/or\n          credited  to  ILT's Cayman  Islands bank\n          account  in  the  approximate amount  of\n          $4.5 million.\n\nSince the  law presumes that a  corporate distribution comes\n\nfrom \"earnings  and profits,\"  leaving the taxpayer  to show\n\nthe contrary, see Hagaman v. Commissioner, 958 F.2d 684, 695\n                                         \n\nn.16  (6th Cir. 1992) (citing cases), were it true that $4.5\n\nmillion  in \"unidentified  amounts\"  were (between  1981 and\n\n1984)  \"deposited  into  and/or  credited  to  ILT's  Cayman\n\nIslands bank account,\" the law would simply presume that the\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\n$2.159 million payment in  1984 was a \"dividend.\"   (This is\n\nso  because  $4.5  million  minus the  $2.159  million  loan\n\nrepayment would still  have left ILT with  $2.341 million in\n\n\"earnings and profits\" -- enough to support a $2.159 million\n\ndividend.)   And, the Lewises  would have to  pay taxes upon\n\nthat dividend income.  \n\n          Unfortunately  for  the  Commissioner, the  record\n\nmakes  clear that  it is  not true that  ILT had  some other\n                                                            \n\nsignificant  source  of  income.   The  1981-1984  ILT  bank\n\naccount deposits are fully explained; and,  ILT did not have\n\n$4.5  million  in  \"earnings and  profits,\"  accumulated  or\n\notherwise.   The  Tax  Court's finding  to  the contrary  is\n\n\"clearly erroneous.\"   See, e.g., Hagaman,  958 F.2d at  690\n                                         \n\n(Tax  Court's findings  accepted  on appeal  unless \"clearly\n\nerroneous\").\n\n          We  reach  this conclusion  because  Lewis himself\n\ntestified,  without contradiction,  that  ILT  had no  other\n                                 \n\nincome.   He said  that ILT  was formed to  serve as  a tax-\n\nsaving entity for TNT's \"local tour\"  money (in other words,\n\nthat ILT was a sham corporation), that the transfers of that\n\n\"local tour\" money constituted ILT's sole significant source\n                                         \n\nof \"income,\"  and that TNT did not transfer any money to ILT\n                                               \n\nafter  1980.   Lewis's  testimony is  supported  by the  Tax\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nCourt's own explanation of  the workings of the Lewis/Belkin\n\ntax  avoidance plan, which fully accounts for the money that\n\nILT received.  Nothing in that explanation suggests that ILT\n\nhad some other source of income.\n              \n\n          Finally,  and  most  important,  the  Commissioner\n\nintroduced  into  evidence  (over the  Lewises's  objection)\n\nILT's 1981-1984 bank account records.  Those records confirm\n\nthat  ILT's  income  during  that  period  consisted  of  1)\n\ninterest  paid on  the Charlesgate  and Taunton  \"loans,\" 2)\n\ninterest earned on the account balance, and 3) the return of\n\nthe  Charlesgate and Taunton \"loan\" principals in 1984.  (We\n\nattach  that exhibit as an  Appendix here.)   The Lewises in\n\ntheir brief go through each entry, showing how it falls into\n\none of  these three  categories (with  the exception  of two\n\nbank  errors  --  a   deposit  notation  of  $1.415  million\n\n(4/26/84), reversed the  same day, and a deposit notation of\n\n$37,625 (5/25/84),  reversed about one month  later).  Their\n\nexplanation  is supported  by  the facts  that  1) the  bank\n\nstatement  shows large  deposits in  the very  \"loan return\"\n\namounts  that  the  Tax  Court  mentions,  2)  many  smaller\n\ndeposits refer  to \"Mido\"  or \"Gran Compania,\"  the entities\n\nthat  should have  paid ILT  interest on  the loans,  3) the\n\nother   deposits,  totalling  roughly   $2.7  million,  bear\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nreferences of \"from fixed [or 'call'] deposit,\" which is how\n\nbanks  sometimes  label  redeposits   from  interest-bearing\n\ninstruments,  and  4)  the  Lewises, in  their  amended  tax\n\nreturns for  1983 and 1984, described  the interest payments\n\nas  \"interest\" and paid  taxes on them.   Not a  word in the\n\nrecord, or in the Commissioner's brief, casts doubt upon the\n\nLewises's  explanation  of  the  record  of  ILT's   account\n\nactivity.       \n\n          To  understand the  Lewises's  explanation of  the\n\ntransfers  to, and redeposits from, certain interest-bearing\n\ninstruments  labelled \"fixed\" or  \"call\" \"deposit,\" consider\n\nthe  following  hypothetical example.   Suppose  a depositor\n\ninstructs a bank to  take money from his account  and invest\n\nit  in an  interest-bearing  instrument (contained,  or  not\n\ncontained, in a  separate interest-bearing account),  and to\n\n\"roll  over\"  the  investment  from  time  to  time  as  the\n\ninterest-bearing instrument expires.  Suppose,  for example,\n\nthat  on January 1, John Smith deposits $10,000 in the local\n\nbank,  along  with an  instruction  to invest  the  money in\n\nTreasury Bills that  expire every three months and  that pay\n\nan annual interest of 5%.  Smith's bank statement might look\n\nsomething like this:\n\n          Date      Deposit     Withdrawal      Balance\n                                                       \n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n          Jan 1     10,000                      10,000\n          Jan 1                   10,000 (to \n                                  T'bills)      0\n          March 31  10,125 (from\n                    T'bills)                    10,125\n          April 1                 10,000 (to \n                                  T'bills)      125\n\n          June 30    10,125 (from                           \n                    T'bills)                    10,250\n\n          July 1                  10,000 (to\n                                  T'bills)      250\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n          Sept 30   10,125 (from\n                    T'bills)                    10,375\n\n          Oct 1                   10,000 (to\n                                  T'bills)      375\n          Dec 31    10,125 (from\n                    T'bills)                    10,500\n\nThe Commissioner  might use this  kind of bank  statement as\n\nevidence  that Smith had interest income of $500, or even as\n\nevidence  that Smith had income of $10,500 (if the source of\n\nthe initial  $10,000 deposit  is  not otherwise  explained).\n\nBut, we  do not see how  the Commissioner -- or,  as in this\n\ncase, the  Tax Court --  could add up  all the  deposits and\n\nthen use this statement as evidence that Smith had income of\n\n$50,500.  The statement shows the contrary.  \n\n          In our view, ILT's bank account, in respect to its\n\n\"fixed/call   deposit\"   references,   is   that    of   our\n\nhypothetical.  The Lewises say in their brief that the back-\n\nand-forth  transfers of  money  between  ILT's  account  and\n\n\"fixed   [or   'call']   deposit\"  represent   intra-account\n                                                            \n\ntransfers  to  and  from  the  \"checking\"  and  \"investment\"\n\nportions  of the  single  account.   This explanation  makes\n\nsense  given  what  we  understand  about  standard  banking\n\nactivity  (i.e., \"fixed  deposit\"  may denote  a fixed-term,\n               \n\ninterest-bearing  certificate of deposit, and \"call deposit\"\n\nmay denote an interest-bearing instrument, say an investment\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nin a money  market fund, which can be recalled  on demand of\n\nthe depositor).  Moreover,  nowhere does the government deny\n                                   \n\nthat these transfers of money were short-term investments of\n\nthe  kind  just  described.    In  essence,  the  government\n\nconcedes the point. \n\n          The  government  argues  that the  Lewises  should\n\nlose, even  if their  bank deposit explanation  is believed,\n\nbecause  they did not  advance that  explanation at  the Tax\n\nCourt's initial  proceeding.   The Lewises did  advance that\n                                              \n\nexplanation,  however,  in  a  motion  for  reconsideration,\n\nimmediately after they  saw what the Tax Court  had written.\n\nOne  can  meet a  burden  of  proof without  disproving,  in\n\nadvance,  all logical alternative  possibilities.   It seems\n\nreasonable for them  not to have made an issue of the matter\n\nearlier, and to have assumed that the government and the Tax\n\nCourt would read a bank deposit statement in accordance with\n\nordinary commercial banking practices.\n\n          Of  course, one  might  wonder how  we  can be  so\n\ncertain  that the Lewises are right about the meaning of the\n\nbank  deposit statement.   The  truthful  answer is  that we\n\ncannot  be completely  certain, for  we are  not experts  in\n                     \n\nbanking  practices.    But,  the  Lewises's  explanation  is\n\nplausible;  it  is  consistent  with what  we  know  of  the\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\ncommercial  world;  and, the  government  could easily  have\n\nprovided  a counter-explanation,  grounded in  accounting or\n\nbanking  principles, were  the Lewises's  explanation wrong.\n\nThe government failed even to advance a contrary argument.  \n\n          If  we put  the  matter in  terms  of \"burdens  of\n\nproof,\" the Lewises satisfied that burden, initially through\n\ntestimony that would have proved sufficient had  the IRS and\n\nthe Tax  Court read the bank deposit statement as reflecting\n\nordinary banking  activity; and,  then, through  a rehearing\n\nmotion with  a full, and uncontroverted,  explanation of the\n\nstatement.   If  we put  the matter  in practical  terms, we\n\nrecall Abraham Lincoln's famous question and reply.  Lincoln\n\nasked his cabinet members, \"How many legs would a sheep have\n\nif you call a tail a leg?\"  \"Five,\" they answered.  \"Wrong,\"\n\nsaid Lincoln, \"the answer is four; calling a tail a leg does\n\nnot make it one.\" \n\n          In sum, the record here shows that Lewis explained\n\nthe sources and amounts  of ILT's income at trial.   Nothing\n\nin  the record  suggests that  his unrebutted  testimony was\n\n\"improbable,  unreasonable,  or  [even] questionable,\"  such\n\nthat the Tax Court could choose to disregard it.  See Estate\n                                                            \n\nof DeNiro v.

And, ILT's  bank statement supports that testimony.\n\nILT  did not  have  \"unexplained  deposits  .  .  .  in  the\n            \n\napproximate amount of  $4.5 million.\"   Insofar as it  rests\n\nupon this  factual error, the  Tax Court's finding  that ILT\n\nhad  \"earnings and profits\" in 1984  sufficient to support a\n\n$2.159   million   \"dividend\"   distribution   is   \"clearly\n\nerroneous.\" \n\n                            III\n\n                   Proceedings on Remand\n                                        \n\n          Our  conclusion  about  the  facts  of  this  case\n\nreturns it  to where we believe it  should have begun.  How,\n\nfor  tax purposes,  should one  characterize the  funds that\n\nflowed to, and then through, ILT in 1984?\n\n          Some  of those funds represent \"interest\" payments\n\nto ILT.   The Lewises agree that they must pay income tax on\n\nthe 1984  distribution to the  extent that ILT  received any\n\nsuch interest.   But, those  sums account for  only a  small\n\npart  of the distribution.  The more important part consists\n\nof ILT's receipt  and subsequent return to  Lewis and Belkin\n\n(through their  \"grantor\" trusts)  of the $2.159  million in\n\nsham loan proceeds.  \n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\n          The Tax Court seemed  to find that this undisputed\n\ntransfer of  funds to  ILT reflected possible  ILT \"earnings\n\nand profits,\" for it said that \n\n          Petitioners have  failed to  show .  . .\n          how a transfer between  separate taxable\n          entities,   i.e.,    a   transfer   from\n          petitioner  and Belkin to ILT, would not\n          be includable in ILT's taxable income or\n          in ILT's earnings and profits.\n\nBut, the question at issue here is not factual; it is legal.\n                                                           \n\nThe   Lewises  did   show,   and  indeed,   the  Tax   Court\n\nacknowledged, what the transfer consisted of, as a matter of\n\nfact.  It consisted of an effort by Lewis and Belkin to send\n    \n\nthemselves some money in  the manner described in Part  I of\n\nthis opinion, namely, by  repaying \"loans\" obtained from ILT\n\nseveral years before, and  flowing the repayment through ILT\n\nto  themselves (in the form of their \"grantor\" trusts).  The\n\nLewises  themselves  now concede  that the  original \"loans\"\n\nwere  shams.   They now dispute,  not the facts,  but how to\n\ncharacterize them as a legal matter.  That is, they deny the\n\nCommissioner's legal right to tax  in 1984 money that should\n\nhave been taxed earlier, in now-closed years.  \n\n          The  law  either does,  or  does  not, permit  the\n\ngovernment  to  tax this  money now.    The taxpayer  has no\n\ngreater  burden   of  \"proving\"   the  law  than   does  the\n\nCommissioner, or, for that matter, the  courts.  Our problem\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nis that neither the  Tax Court, nor the  Commissioner, seems\n\nthoroughly  to have considered a portion of the law that may\n\nanswer the legal question.  Our  own research has led us  to\n\nconclude that  a type of estoppel known  as \"quasi estoppel\"\n\nor the \"duty of  consistency\" might operate  in a way as  to\n                                   \n\nprevent the Lewises from denying the taxability, in 1984, of\n\nthe  $1,062,500 distribution.    This \"duty  of consistency\"\n\nprevents a taxpayer who  has already had the advantage  of a\n\npast  misrepresentation -- in a year now closed to review by\n\nthe  government  --  from  changing  his  position  and,  by\n\nclaiming he should  have paid more tax before,  avoiding the\n\npresent  tax.  See Beltzer  v. United States,  495 F.2d 211,\n                                            \n\n212-13 (8th Cir. 1974).  \n\n          The \"duty of consistency\"  seems to apply when the\n\nearlier taxpayer position amounts to a misstatement of fact,\n\nnot of law.  See, e.g., Herrington v.

Moreover, the misstatement  must be  one on\n\nwhich the government reasonably relied, in the sense that it\n\nneither  knew, nor ought to  have known, the  true nature of\n\nthe  transaction  mischaracterized  by  the  taxpayer.

Since it has not  been argued here, and since\n\nfactual  history  is  at issue,  both  the  Lewises  and the\n\nCommissioner  should have  a full  opportunity to  argue the\n\nissue before the  Tax Court.   We therefore  vacate the  Tax\n\nCourt's  judgment insofar  as it  is inconsistent  with this\n\nopinion.   And,  we remand  the case  to  the Tax  Court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\n          So ordered.\n                    \n\nNOTE:  See Slip Opinion for Appendix.\n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n",

In the Tax Court's view, that money represented an ILT \"dividend,\" paid to the Lewises at that time.  See I.R.C. Sec. 301(a), (c)(1)-(3) (1986).  The Lewises disagree.  They point out that a \"dividend\" must come from a corporation's \"earnings and profits.\"   See id. Sec. 316(a).  And, they argue, ILT had no \"earnings and profits,\" either in or before 1984, from which it might have paid a \"dividend\" in 1984.  The Tax Court's contrary conclusion, they believe, rests upon a simple, and clear, factual error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Lewises further argue that, if ILT's distribution of the $1,062,500 is not a dividend, neither is it any other kind of 1984 taxable \"income.\"   See id. Sec. 61 (defining \"gross income\" as \"all income from whatever source derived\").  Rather, in their view, the 1984 distribution represents income that they constructively received in, and accumulated from, earlier years, namely from the years 1974 through 1980.  The Lewises concede that they should have paid (but never have paid ) income tax on this money sometime between 1974 and 1981.  But, as all parties concede, the statute of limitations now bars the Commissioner from assessing taxes for those earlier years.  And, in the Lewises's view, the Commissioner cannot subvert the letter, and the spirit, of that statute by taxing now income that the government should have taxed then.   The Lewises conclude that we should, therefore, simply reverse the Tax Court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the Lewises are correct about the Tax Court's factual error.  The record makes clear that the 1984 distribution did not come from ILT's \"earnings and profits.\"   It is, as the Lewises say, some form of accumulated income that the Lewises \"constructively received\" in prior, and now-closed, tax years.  But, whether or not the Lewises must pay taxes on that distribution is a different matter.  In adjudicating tax cases, the courts have developed a type of estoppel known as \"quasi estoppel\" or the \"duty of consistency,\" whereby a taxpayer may not take a position in one year to his advantage, and then at some later point, after correction for that year is barred by the statute of limitations, adopt a contrary position touching on the same facts or transaction.  Jacob Mertens, Jr., The Law of Federal Income Taxation Sec. 60.05 (1992).  Whether that doctrine requires the Lewises to treat the 1984 ILT distribution as taxable income is a matter so far addressed only superficially by the parties and upon which we wish the Tax Court's views.  We therefore decline the Lewises's invitation to hold that the $1,062,500 is not taxable to them in 1984, and we remand this case to the Tax Court for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>* Background Facts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand the Tax Court's factual error, one must have in mind a rather complex (and here undisputed) set of events, some of which took place before, and others after, December 1980, when ILT's bank account showed a zero balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>* Before December 1980</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arises out of an effort by Alan Lewis, and Steven Belkin, his business associate, to avoid paying federal income taxes on revenue generated primarily in Europe by their travel business, Trans National Travel (\"TNT\").  Two key sets of events took place before December 1980.  First, between 1974 and 1980, Lewis and Belkin had TNT employees send TNT revenue generated by the sale of local (e.g., European city) tours in Europe to the Cayman Island bank account of ILT, a foreign corporation that they owned and controlled.  ILT transferred some of the money received from TNT to two Cayman Island trusts.  Those trusts, it later turned out, were \"grantor\" trusts of Lewis and Belkin (meaning, basically, that Lewis and Belkin should have paid income tax on the money those trusts received when the trusts received it.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and more important for present purposes, between 1977 and 1980 ILT \"loaned\" the rest of the money received from TNT to two limited partnerships formed and controlled by Lewis and Belkin.  In effect, this was money \"loaned\" by Lewis and Belkin to themselves, for the purpose of making some personal investments.  The total amount of these \"loans\" was approximately $2.075 million.  There were three such \"loans,\" each of which involved money that travelled a circuitous path, reaching Lewis and Belkin through paper intermediaries:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) In 1977, ILT loaned $800,000 to Gran Compania De Comercio, which reloaned the money to Windikip Financieringsmaatschappij B.V., which in turn reloaned the money to Charlesgate West Associates.  We assume that Gran Compania and Windikip were Lewis/Belkin-controlled entities that existed only on paper (though their use may have avoided the need to withhold U.S. taxes on interest payments).  Charlesgate was a Lewis/Belkin real estate partnership, which used the money for the benefit of Lewis and Belkin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) In 1978, ILT loaned Charlesgate West Associates an additional $600,000, using the same intermediaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c) In 1980, ILT loaned $675,000 to a Lewis/Belkin-controlled real estate partnership named Taunton Boulevard Associates, which used the money for their benefit.  This time the intermediaries consisted of two different foreign entities called \"Mido Capital Venture, N.V.\" and \"Bristol Realty Trust.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each instance, the lending entity and all the borrowing entities created all the necessary loan-related documentation.  Thus, on paper, it seemed as if Charlesgate owed Windikip (which owed Gran Compania, which owed ILT) regular payments of interest plus repayment of principal.  Similarly, it seemed, on paper, as if Taunton owed Bristol (which owed Mido, which owed ILT) regular payments of interest plus repayment of principal.  The Tax Court found, however, that neither Lewis nor Belkin, the persons in control of Charlesgate and Taunton Associates, ever intended to pay back the $2.075 million in \"loans\" to ILT.  Hence, for tax purposes, they were not loans at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the end of 1980, ILT apparently had paid out all the TNT money it had received either 1) to the Lewis/Belkin \"grantor\" trusts, or 2) to the Lewis/Belkin real estate partnerships by way of the $2.075 million Charlesgate and Taunton loans.  As we have said, the Tax Court found that, as of December 31, 1980, ILT's bank balance was zero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <p>After 1980</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three significant events occurred after 1980.  First, in 1983, Belkin and Lewis ended their business association.  As part of their consequent efforts to divide property jointly owned or controlled, they decided to repay the three \"loans\" from ILT.  They therefore reversed the \"money flow,\" having (in the one case) Gran Compania (paid by Windikip, paid by Charlesgate) pay ILT $1.4 million, and (in the other case) Mido Capital (paid by Bristol Realty, paid by Taunton) pay ILT $708,658.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, ILT, having received this money (plus related interest) from Gran Compania and Mido, divided it in half, distributing $1,079,329 to Belkin's \"grantor\" trust and $1,079,329 to Lewis's \"grantor\" trust.  The adjusted amount ($1,062,500) of this distribution to Lewis's \"grantor\" trust in 1984 (which, as noted above, amounts for tax purposes to a distribution to Lewis himself) is the money at issue here.II</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Tax Court's Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual record, as just described, suggests that the underlying, and possibly difficult, question in this case is not one of finding the facts, but rather, one of characterizing facts that are essentially beyond dispute.  Is ILT's 1984 distribution of roughly $2.159 million taxable \"income\" to its recipients in light of the fact that that distribution originated in the repayment of sham loans (made in years now closed to review), the funds for which \"loans,\" in turn, originally took the form of what may have been taxable (but untaxed) income to those same recipients (again, in years now closed to review)?   The Tax Court avoided this question, however, by finding as fact that ILT had other \"earnings and profits\" out of which its 1984 distribution could have been made.  The Tax Court found that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>between 1981 and 1984, unidentified amounts were deposited into and/or credited to ILT's Cayman Islands bank account in the approximate amount of $4.5 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the law presumes that a corporate distribution comes from \"earnings and profits,\" leaving the taxpayer to show the contrary, see Hagaman v. Commissioner, 958 F.2d 684, 695 n. 16 (6th Cir.1992) (citing cases), were it true that $4.5 million in \"unidentified amounts\" were (between 1981 and 1984) \"deposited into and/or credited to ILT's Cayman Islands bank account,\" the law would simply presume that the $2.159 million payment in 1984 was a \"dividend.\"  (This is so because $4.5 million minus the $2.159 million loan repayment would still have left ILT with $2.341 million in \"earnings and profits\"--enough to support a $2.159 million dividend.)   And, the Lewises would have to pay taxes upon that dividend income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for the Commissioner, the record makes clear that it is not true that ILT had some other significant source of income.  The 1981-1984 ILT bank account deposits are fully explained;  and, ILT did not have $4.5 million in \"earnings and profits,\" accumulated or otherwise.  The Tax Court's finding to the contrary is \"clearly erroneous.\"   See, e.g., Hagaman, 958 F.2d at 690 (Tax Court's findings accepted on appeal unless \"clearly erroneous\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reach this conclusion because Lewis himself testified, without contradiction, that ILT had no other income.  He said that ILT was formed to serve as a tax-saving entity for TNT's \"local tour\" money (in other words, that ILT was a sham corporation), that the transfers of that \"local tour\" money constituted ILT's sole significant source of \"income,\" and that TNT did not transfer any money to ILT after 1980.  Lewis's testimony is supported by the Tax Court's own explanation of the workings of the Lewis/Belkin tax avoidance plan, which fully accounts for the money that ILT received.  Nothing in that explanation suggests that ILT had some other source of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and most important, the Commissioner introduced into evidence (over the Lewises's objection) ILT's 1981-1984 bank account records.  Those records confirm that ILT's income during that period consisted of 1) interest paid on the Charlesgate and Taunton \"loans,\" 2) interest earned on the account balance, and 3) the return of the Charlesgate and Taunton \"loan\" principals in 1984.  (We attach that exhibit as an Appendix here.)   The Lewises in their brief go through each entry, showing how it falls into one of these three categories (with the exception of two bank errors--a deposit notation of $1.415 million (4/26/84), reversed the same day, and a deposit notation of $37,625 (5/25/84), reversed about one month later).  Their explanation is supported by the facts that 1) the bank statement shows large deposits in the very \"loan return\" amounts that the Tax Court mentions, 2) many smaller deposits refer to \"Mido\" or \"Gran Compania,\" the entities that should have paid ILT interest on the loans, 3) the other deposits, totalling roughly $2.7 million, bear references of \"from fixed [or 'call'] deposit,\" which is how banks sometimes label redeposits from interest-bearing instruments, and 4) the Lewises, in their amended tax returns for 1983 and 1984, described the interest payments as \"interest\" and paid taxes on them.  Not a word in the record, or in the Commissioner's brief, casts doubt upon the Lewises's explanation of the record of ILT's account activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand the Lewises's explanation of the transfers to, and redeposits from, certain interest-bearing instruments labelled \"fixed\" or \"call\" \"deposit,\" consider the following hypothetical example.  Suppose a depositor instructs a bank to take money from his account and invest it in an interest-bearing instrument (contained, or not contained, in a separate interest-bearing account), and to \"roll over\" the investment from time to time as the interest-bearing instrument expires.  Suppose, for example, that on January 1, John Smith deposits $10,000 in the local bank, along with an instruction to invest the money in Treasury Bills that expire every three months and that pay an annual interest of 5%.  Smith's bank statement might look something like this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <pre>Date              Deposit           Withdrawal        Balance\nJan 1             10,000                              10,000\nJan 1                               10,000 (to\n                                    T'bills)          0\nMarch 31          10,125 (from\n                  T'bills)                            10,125\nApril 1                             10,000 (to\n                                    T'bills)          125\nJune 30           10,125 (from\n                  T'bills)                            10,250\nJuly 1                              10,000 (to\n                                    T'bills)          250\nSept 30           10,125 (from\n                  T'bills)                            10,375\nOct 1                               10,000 (to\n                                    T'bills)          375\nDec 31            10,125 (from\n                  T'bills)                            10,500</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner might use this kind of bank statement as evidence that Smith had interest income of $500, or even as evidence that Smith had income of $10,500 (if the source of the initial $10,000 deposit is not otherwise explained).  But, we do not see how the Commissioner--or, as in this case, the Tax Court--could add up all the deposits and then use this statement as evidence that Smith had income of $50,500.  The statement shows the contrary.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In our view, ILT's bank account, in respect to its \"fixed/call deposit\" references, is that of our hypothetical.  The Lewises say in their brief that the back-and-forth transfers of money between ILT's account and \"fixed [or 'call'] deposit\" represent intra-account transfers to and from the \"checking\" and \"investment\" portions of the single account.  This explanation makes sense given what we understand about standard banking activity (i.e., \"fixed deposit\" may denote a fixed-term, interest-bearing certificate of deposit, and \"call deposit\" may denote an interest-bearing instrument, say an investment in a money market fund, which can be recalled on demand of the depositor).  Moreover, nowhere does the government deny that these transfers of money were short-term investments of the kind just described.  In essence, the government concedes the point.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the Lewises should lose, even if their bank deposit explanation is believed, because they did not advance that explanation at the Tax Court's initial proceeding.  The Lewises did advance that explanation, however, in a motion for reconsideration, immediately after they saw what the Tax Court had written.  One can meet a burden of proof without disproving, in advance, all logical alternative possibilities.  It seems reasonable for them not to have made an issue of the matter earlier, and to have assumed that the government and the Tax Court would read a bank deposit statement in accordance with ordinary commercial banking practices.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Of course, one might wonder how we can be so certain that the Lewises are right about the meaning of the bank deposit statement.  The truthful answer is that we cannot be completely certain, for we are not experts in banking practices.  But, the Lewises's explanation is plausible;  it is consistent with what we know of the commercial world;  and, the government could easily have provided a counter-explanation, grounded in accounting or banking principles, were the Lewises's explanation wrong.  The government failed even to advance a contrary argument.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If we put the matter in terms of \"burdens of proof,\" the Lewises satisfied that burden, initially through testimony that would have proved sufficient had the IRS and the Tax Court read the bank deposit statement as reflecting ordinary banking activity;  and, then, through a rehearing motion with a full, and uncontroverted, explanation of the statement.  If we put the matter in practical terms, we recall Abraham Lincoln's famous question and reply.  Lincoln asked his cabinet members, \"How many legs would a sheep have if you call a tail a leg?\"  \"Five,\" they answered.  \"Wrong,\" said Lincoln, \"the answer is four;  calling a tail a leg does not make it one.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record here shows that Lewis explained the sources and amounts of ILT's income at trial.  Nothing in the record suggests that his unrebutted testimony was \"improbable, unreasonable, or [even] questionable,\" such that the Tax Court could choose to disregard it.  See Estate of DeNiro v. Commissioner, 746 F.2d 327, 331 (6th Cir.1984) (citing Commissioner v. Smith, 285 F.2d 91, 96 (5th Cir.1960)).  And, ILT's bank statement supports that testimony.  ILT did not have \"unexplained deposits ... in the approximate amount of $4.5 million.\"   Insofar as it rests upon this factual error, the Tax Court's finding that ILT had \"earnings and profits\" in 1984 sufficient to support a $2.159 million \"dividend\" distribution is \"clearly erroneous.\"</p>\n        <p>III</p>\n        <p>Proceedings on Remand</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion about the facts of this case returns it to where we believe it should have begun.  How, for tax purposes, should one characterize the funds that flowed to, and then through, ILT in 1984?</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Some of those funds represent \"interest\" payments to ILT.  The Lewises agree that they must pay income tax on the 1984 distribution to the extent that ILT received any such interest.  But, those sums account for only a small part of the distribution.  The more important part consists of ILT's receipt and subsequent return to Lewis and Belkin (through their \"grantor\" trusts) of the $2.159 million in sham loan proceeds.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court seemed to find that this undisputed transfer of funds to ILT reflected possible ILT \"earnings and profits,\" for it said that</p>\n        <p>Petitioners have failed to show ... how a transfer between separate taxable entities, i.e., a transfer from petitioner and Belkin to ILT, would not be includable in ILT's taxable income or in ILT's earnings and profits.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">But, the question at issue here is not factual;  it is legal.   The Lewises did show, and indeed, the Tax Court acknowledged, what the transfer consisted of, as a matter of fact.   It consisted of an effort by Lewis and Belkin to send themselves some money in the manner described in Part I of this opinion, namely, by repaying \"loans\" obtained from ILT several years before, and flowing the repayment through ILT to themselves (in the form of their \"grantor\" trusts).  The Lewises themselves now concede that the original \"loans\" were shams.  They now dispute, not the facts, but how to characterize them as a legal matter.  That is, they deny the Commissioner's legal right to tax in 1984 money that should have been taxed earlier, in now-closed years.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The law either does, or does not, permit the government to tax this money now.  The taxpayer has no greater burden of \"proving\" the law than does the Commissioner, or, for that matter, the courts.  Our problem is that neither the Tax Court, nor the Commissioner, seems thoroughly to have considered a portion of the law that may answer the legal question.  Our own research has led us to conclude that a type of estoppel known as \"quasi estoppel\" or the \"duty of consistency\" might operate in a way as to prevent the Lewises from denying the taxability, in 1984, of the $1,062,500 distribution.  This \"duty of consistency\" prevents a taxpayer who has already had the advantage of a past misrepresentation--in a year now closed to review by the government--from changing his position and, by claiming he should have paid more tax before, avoiding the present tax.  See Beltzer v. United States, 495 F.2d 211, 212-13 (8th Cir.1974).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The \"duty of consistency\" seems to apply when the earlier taxpayer position amounts to a misstatement of fact, not of law.  See, e.g., Herrington v. Commissioner, 854 F.2d 755, 758 (5th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1065, 109 S.Ct. 2062, 104 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989);  Beltzer, 495 F.2d at 213;  Mayfair Minerals, Inc. v. Commissioner, 456 F.2d 622, 623 (5th Cir.1972);  Crosley Corp. v. United States, 229 F.2d 376, 380 (6th Cir.1956);  Ross v. Commissioner, 169 F.2d 483, 496 (1st Cir.1948) (simple failure to report income \"is not a representation that such income has in fact not been received\" and does not, without more, furnish grounds for estoppel);  Mertens, supra, Sec. 60.05 (\"Where there is a mistake of law and no factual misrepresentations, the doctrine of consistency does not apply.\").  Moreover, the misstatement must be one on which the government reasonably relied, in the sense that it neither knew, nor ought to have known, the true nature of the transaction mischaracterized by the taxpayer.  See Herrington, 854 F.2d at 758;  Mayfair Minerals, 456 F.2d at 623;  Ross, 169 F.2d at 495-96.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In this case, it seems possible that Lewis made representations of key facts regarding the genuine business activities of ILT throughout the 1970's and the genuine intent on his and Belkin's part to repay the ILT \"loans.\"   If such representations of fact were made, then holding Lewis to them now might generate a 1984 tax liability.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We stress, however, that we are uncertain about this matter.  Since it has not been argued here, and since factual history is at issue, both the Lewises and the Commissioner should have a full opportunity to argue the issue before the Tax Court.  We therefore vacate the Tax Court's judgment insofar as it is inconsistent with this opinion.  And, we remand the case to the Tax Court for further proceedings.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In the Tax Court's view, that money represented an ILT \"dividend,\" paid to the Lewises at that time.  See I.R.C. Sec. 301(a), (c)(1)-(3) (1986).  The Lewises disagree.  They point out that a \"dividend\" must come from a corporation's \"earnings and profits.\"   See id. Sec. 316(a).  And, they argue, ILT had no \"earnings and profits,\" either in or before 1984, from which it might have paid a \"dividend\" in 1984.  The Tax Court's contrary conclusion, they believe, rests upon a simple, and clear, factual error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Lewises further argue that, if ILT's distribution of the $1,062,500 is not a dividend, neither is it any other kind of 1984 taxable \"income.\"   See id. Sec. 61 (defining \"gross income\" as \"all income from whatever source derived\").  Rather, in their view, the 1984 distribution represents income that they constructively received in, and accumulated from, earlier years, namely from the years 1974 through 1980.  The Lewises concede that they should have paid (but never have paid ) income tax on this money sometime between 1974 and 1981.  But, as all parties concede, the statute of limitations now bars the Commissioner from assessing taxes for those earlier years.  And, in the Lewises's view, the Commissioner cannot subvert the letter, and the spirit, of that statute by taxing now income that the government should have taxed then.   The Lewises conclude that we should, therefore, simply reverse the Tax Court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the Lewises are correct about the Tax Court's factual error.  The record makes clear that the 1984 distribution did not come from ILT's \"earnings and profits.\"   It is, as the Lewises say, some form of accumulated income that the Lewises \"constructively received\" in prior, and now-closed, tax years.  But, whether or not the Lewises must pay taxes on that distribution is a different matter.  In adjudicating tax cases, the courts have developed a type of estoppel known as \"quasi estoppel\" or the \"duty of consistency,\" whereby a taxpayer may not take a position in one year to his advantage, and then at some later point, after correction for that year is barred by the statute of limitations, adopt a contrary position touching on the same facts or transaction.  Jacob Mertens, Jr., The Law of Federal Income Taxation Sec. 60.05 (1992).  Whether that doctrine requires the Lewises to treat the 1984 ILT distribution as taxable income is a matter so far addressed only superficially by the parties and upon which we wish the Tax Court's views.  We therefore decline the Lewises's invitation to hold that the $1,062,500 is not taxable to them in 1984, and we remand this case to the Tax Court for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>* Background Facts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand the Tax Court's factual error, one must have in mind a rather complex (and here undisputed) set of events, some of which took place before, and others after, December 1980, when ILT's bank account showed a zero balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>* Before December 1980</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arises out of an effort by Alan Lewis, and Steven Belkin, his business associate, to avoid paying federal income taxes on revenue generated primarily in Europe by their travel business, Trans National Travel (\"TNT\").  Two key sets of events took place before December 1980.  First, between 1974 and 1980, Lewis and Belkin had TNT employees send TNT revenue generated by the sale of local (e.g., European city) tours in Europe to the Cayman Island bank account of ILT, a foreign corporation that they owned and controlled.  ILT transferred some of the money received from TNT to two Cayman Island trusts.  Those trusts, it later turned out, were \"grantor\" trusts of Lewis and Belkin (meaning, basically, that Lewis and Belkin should have paid income tax on the money those trusts received when the trusts received it.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and more important for present purposes, between 1977 and 1980 ILT \"loaned\" the rest of the money received from TNT to two limited partnerships formed and controlled by Lewis and Belkin.  In effect, this was money \"loaned\" by Lewis and Belkin to themselves, for the purpose of making some personal investments.  The total amount of these \"loans\" was approximately $2.075 million.  There were three such \"loans,\" each of which involved money that travelled a circuitous path, reaching Lewis and Belkin through paper intermediaries:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) In 1977, ILT loaned $800,000 to Gran Compania De Comercio, which reloaned the money to Windikip Financieringsmaatschappij B.V., which in turn reloaned the money to Charlesgate West Associates.  We assume that Gran Compania and Windikip were Lewis/Belkin-controlled entities that existed only on paper (though their use may have avoided the need to withhold U.S. taxes on interest payments).  Charlesgate was a Lewis/Belkin real estate partnership, which used the money for the benefit of Lewis and Belkin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) In 1978, ILT loaned Charlesgate West Associates an additional $600,000, using the same intermediaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c) In 1980, ILT loaned $675,000 to a Lewis/Belkin-controlled real estate partnership named Taunton Boulevard Associates, which used the money for their benefit.  This time the intermediaries consisted of two different foreign entities called \"Mido Capital Venture, N.V.\" and \"Bristol Realty Trust.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each instance, the lending entity and all the borrowing entities created all the necessary loan-related documentation.  Thus, on paper, it seemed as if Charlesgate owed Windikip (which owed Gran Compania, which owed ILT) regular payments of interest plus repayment of principal.  Similarly, it seemed, on paper, as if Taunton owed Bristol (which owed Mido, which owed ILT) regular payments of interest plus repayment of principal.  The Tax Court found, however, that neither Lewis nor Belkin, the persons in control of Charlesgate and Taunton Associates, ever intended to pay back the $2.075 million in \"loans\" to ILT.  Hence, for tax purposes, they were not loans at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the end of 1980, ILT apparently had paid out all the TNT money it had received either 1) to the Lewis/Belkin \"grantor\" trusts, or 2) to the Lewis/Belkin real estate partnerships by way of the $2.075 million Charlesgate and Taunton loans.  As we have said, the Tax Court found that, as of December 31, 1980, ILT's bank balance was zero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <p>After 1980</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three significant events occurred after 1980.  First, in 1983, Belkin and Lewis ended their business association.  As part of their consequent efforts to divide property jointly owned or controlled, they decided to repay the three \"loans\" from ILT.  They therefore reversed the \"money flow,\" having (in the one case) Gran Compania (paid by Windikip, paid by Charlesgate) pay ILT $1.4 million, and (in the other case) Mido Capital (paid by Bristol Realty, paid by Taunton) pay ILT $708,658.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, ILT, having received this money (plus related interest) from Gran Compania and Mido, divided it in half, distributing $1,079,329 to Belkin's \"grantor\" trust and $1,079,329 to Lewis's \"grantor\" trust.  The adjusted amount ($1,062,500) of this distribution to Lewis's \"grantor\" trust in 1984 (which, as noted above, amounts for tax purposes to a distribution to Lewis himself) is the money at issue here.II</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Tax Court's Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual record, as just described, suggests that the underlying, and possibly difficult, question in this case is not one of finding the facts, but rather, one of characterizing facts that are essentially beyond dispute.  Is ILT's 1984 distribution of roughly $2.159 million taxable \"income\" to its recipients in light of the fact that that distribution originated in the repayment of sham loans (made in years now closed to review), the funds for which \"loans,\" in turn, originally took the form of what may have been taxable (but untaxed) income to those same recipients (again, in years now closed to review)?   The Tax Court avoided this question, however, by finding as fact that ILT had other \"earnings and profits\" out of which its 1984 distribution could have been made.  The Tax Court found that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>between 1981 and 1984, unidentified amounts were deposited into and/or credited to ILT's Cayman Islands bank account in the approximate amount of $4.5 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the law presumes that a corporate distribution comes from \"earnings and profits,\" leaving the taxpayer to show the contrary, see Hagaman v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579233\"><a href=\"/opinion/579233/william-s-hagaman-bonnie-c-hagaman-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, 695 n. 16 (6th Cir.1992) (citing cases), were it true that $4.5 million in \"unidentified amounts\" were (between 1981 and 1984) \"deposited into and/or credited to ILT's Cayman Islands bank account,\" the law would simply presume that the $2.159 million payment in 1984 was a \"dividend.\"  (This is so because $4.5 million minus the $2.159 million loan repayment would still have left ILT with $2.341 million in \"earnings and profits\"--enough to support a $2.159 million dividend.)   And, the Lewises would have to pay taxes upon that dividend income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for the Commissioner, the record makes clear that it is not true that ILT had some other significant source of income.  The 1981-1984 ILT bank account deposits are fully explained;  and, ILT did not have $4.5 million in \"earnings and profits,\" accumulated or otherwise.  The Tax Court's finding to the contrary is \"clearly erroneous.\"   See, e.g., Hagaman, 958 F.2d at 690 (Tax Court's findings accepted on appeal unless \"clearly erroneous\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reach this conclusion because Lewis himself testified, without contradiction, that ILT had no other income.  He said that ILT was formed to serve as a tax-saving entity for TNT's \"local tour\" money (in other words, that ILT was a sham corporation), that the transfers of that \"local tour\" money constituted ILT's sole significant source of \"income,\" and that TNT did not transfer any money to ILT after 1980.  Lewis's testimony is supported by the Tax Court's own explanation of the workings of the Lewis/Belkin tax avoidance plan, which fully accounts for the money that ILT received.  Nothing in that explanation suggests that ILT had some other source of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and most important, the Commissioner introduced into evidence (over the Lewises's objection) ILT's 1981-1984 bank account records.  Those records confirm that ILT's income during that period consisted of 1) interest paid on the Charlesgate and Taunton \"loans,\" 2) interest earned on the account balance, and 3) the return of the Charlesgate and Taunton \"loan\" principals in 1984.  (We attach that exhibit as an Appendix here.)   The Lewises in their brief go through each entry, showing how it falls into one of these three categories (with the exception of two bank errors--a deposit notation of $1.415 million (4/26/84), reversed the same day, and a deposit notation of $37,625 (5/25/84), reversed about one month later).  Their explanation is supported by the facts that 1) the bank statement shows large deposits in the very \"loan return\" amounts that the Tax Court mentions, 2) many smaller deposits refer to \"Mido\" or \"Gran Compania,\" the entities that should have paid ILT interest on the loans, 3) the other deposits, totalling roughly $2.7 million, bear references of \"from fixed [or 'call'] deposit,\" which is how banks sometimes label redeposits from interest-bearing instruments, and 4) the Lewises, in their amended tax returns for 1983 and 1984, described the interest payments as \"interest\" and paid taxes on them.  Not a word in the record, or in the Commissioner's brief, casts doubt upon the Lewises's explanation of the record of ILT's account activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand the Lewises's explanation of the transfers to, and redeposits from, certain interest-bearing instruments labelled \"fixed\" or \"call\" \"deposit,\" consider the following hypothetical example.  Suppose a depositor instructs a bank to take money from his account and invest it in an interest-bearing instrument (contained, or not contained, in a separate interest-bearing account), and to \"roll over\" the investment from time to time as the interest-bearing instrument expires.  Suppose, for example, that on January 1, John Smith deposits $10,000 in the local bank, along with an instruction to invest the money in Treasury Bills that expire every three months and that pay an annual interest of 5%.  Smith's bank statement might look something like this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <pre>Date              Deposit           Withdrawal        Balance\nJan 1             10,000                              10,000\nJan 1                               10,000 (to\n                                    T'bills)          0\nMarch 31          10,125 (from\n                  T'bills)                            10,125\nApril 1                             10,000 (to\n                                    T'bills)          125\nJune 30           10,125 (from\n                  T'bills)                            10,250\nJuly 1                              10,000 (to\n                                    T'bills)          250\nSept 30           10,125 (from\n                  T'bills)                            10,375\nOct 1                               10,000 (to\n                                    T'bills)          375\nDec 31            10,125 (from\n                  T'bills)                            10,500</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner might use this kind of bank statement as evidence that Smith had interest income of $500, or even as evidence that Smith had income of $10,500 (if the source of the initial $10,000 deposit is not otherwise explained).  But, we do not see how the Commissioner--or, as in this case, the Tax Court--could add up all the deposits and then use this statement as evidence that Smith had income of $50,500.  The statement shows the contrary.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In our view, ILT's bank account, in respect to its \"fixed/call deposit\" references, is that of our hypothetical.  The Lewises say in their brief that the back-and-forth transfers of money between ILT's account and \"fixed [or 'call'] deposit\" represent intra-account transfers to and from the \"checking\" and \"investment\" portions of the single account.  This explanation makes sense given what we understand about standard banking activity (i.e., \"fixed deposit\" may denote a fixed-term, interest-bearing certificate of deposit, and \"call deposit\" may denote an interest-bearing instrument, say an investment in a money market fund, which can be recalled on demand of the depositor).  Moreover, nowhere does the government deny that these transfers of money were short-term investments of the kind just described.  In essence, the government concedes the point.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the Lewises should lose, even if their bank deposit explanation is believed, because they did not advance that explanation at the Tax Court's initial proceeding.  The Lewises did advance that explanation, however, in a motion for reconsideration, immediately after they saw what the Tax Court had written.  One can meet a burden of proof without disproving, in advance, all logical alternative possibilities.  It seems reasonable for them not to have made an issue of the matter earlier, and to have assumed that the government and the Tax Court would read a bank deposit statement in accordance with ordinary commercial banking practices.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Of course, one might wonder how we can be so certain that the Lewises are right about the meaning of the bank deposit statement.  The truthful answer is that we cannot be completely certain, for we are not experts in banking practices.  But, the Lewises's explanation is plausible;  it is consistent with what we know of the commercial world;  and, the government could easily have provided a counter-explanation, grounded in accounting or banking principles, were the Lewises's explanation wrong.  The government failed even to advance a contrary argument.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If we put the matter in terms of \"burdens of proof,\" the Lewises satisfied that burden, initially through testimony that would have proved sufficient had the IRS and the Tax Court read the bank deposit statement as reflecting ordinary banking activity;  and, then, through a rehearing motion with a full, and uncontroverted, explanation of the statement.  If we put the matter in practical terms, we recall Abraham Lincoln's famous question and reply.  Lincoln asked his cabinet members, \"How many legs would a sheep have if you call a tail a leg?\"  \"Five,\" they answered.  \"Wrong,\" said Lincoln, \"the answer is four;  calling a tail a leg does not make it one.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record here shows that Lewis explained the sources and amounts of ILT's income at trial.  Nothing in the record suggests that his unrebutted testimony was \"improbable, unreasonable, or [even] questionable,\" such that the Tax Court could choose to disregard it.  See Estate of DeNiro v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443015\"><a href=\"/opinion/443015/estate-of-vincent-deniro-deceased-helen-m-papalie-and-joanne-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 331 (6th Cir.1984) (citing Commissioner v.

And, ILT's bank statement supports that testimony.  ILT did not have \"unexplained deposits ... in the approximate amount of $4.5 million.\"   Insofar as it rests upon this factual error, the Tax Court's finding that ILT had \"earnings and profits\" in 1984 sufficient to support a $2.159 million \"dividend\" distribution is \"clearly erroneous.\"</p>\n        <p>III</p>\n        <p>Proceedings on Remand</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion about the facts of this case returns it to where we believe it should have begun.  How, for tax purposes, should one characterize the funds that flowed to, and then through, ILT in 1984?</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Some of those funds represent \"interest\" payments to ILT.  The Lewises agree that they must pay income tax on the 1984 distribution to the extent that ILT received any such interest.  But, those sums account for only a small part of the distribution.  The more important part consists of ILT's receipt and subsequent return to Lewis and Belkin (through their \"grantor\" trusts) of the $2.159 million in sham loan proceeds.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court seemed to find that this undisputed transfer of funds to ILT reflected possible ILT \"earnings and profits,\" for it said that</p>\n        <p>Petitioners have failed to show ... how a transfer between separate taxable entities, i.e., a transfer from petitioner and Belkin to ILT, would not be includable in ILT's taxable income or in ILT's earnings and profits.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">But, the question at issue here is not factual;  it is legal.   The Lewises did show, and indeed, the Tax Court acknowledged, what the transfer consisted of, as a matter of fact.   It consisted of an effort by Lewis and Belkin to send themselves some money in the manner described in Part I of this opinion, namely, by repaying \"loans\" obtained from ILT several years before, and flowing the repayment through ILT to themselves (in the form of their \"grantor\" trusts).  The Lewises themselves now concede that the original \"loans\" were shams.  They now dispute, not the facts, but how to characterize them as a legal matter.  That is, they deny the Commissioner's legal right to tax in 1984 money that should have been taxed earlier, in now-closed years.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The law either does, or does not, permit the government to tax this money now.  The taxpayer has no greater burden of \"proving\" the law than does the Commissioner, or, for that matter, the courts.  Our problem is that neither the Tax Court, nor the Commissioner, seems thoroughly to have considered a portion of the law that may answer the legal question.  Our own research has led us to conclude that a type of estoppel known as \"quasi estoppel\" or the \"duty of consistency\" might operate in a way as to prevent the Lewises from denying the taxability, in 1984, of the $1,062,500 distribution.  This \"duty of consistency\" prevents a taxpayer who has already had the advantage of a past misrepresentation--in a year now closed to review by the government--from changing his position and, by claiming he should have paid more tax before, avoiding the present tax.  See Beltzer v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"318479\"><a href=\"/opinion/318479/william-a-beltzer-and-sharon-beltzer-and-v-united-states-of-america-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 212-13 (8th Cir.1974).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The \"duty of consistency\" seems to apply when the earlier taxpayer position amounts to a misstatement of fact, not of law.

Moreover, the misstatement must be one on which the government reasonably relied, in the sense that it neither knew, nor ought to have known, the true nature of the transaction mischaracterized by the taxpayer.  See Herrington, 854 F.2d at 758;  Mayfair Minerals, 456 F.2d at 623;  Ross, 169 F.2d at 495-96.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In this case, it seems possible that Lewis made representations of key facts regarding the genuine business activities of ILT throughout the 1970's and the genuine intent on his and Belkin's part to repay the ILT \"loans.\"   If such representations of fact were made, then holding Lewis to them now might generate a 1984 tax liability.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We stress, however, that we are uncertain about this matter.  Since it has not been argued here, and since factual history is at issue, both the Lewises and the Commissioner should have a full opportunity to argue the issue before the Tax Court.  We therefore vacate the Tax Court's judgment insofar as it is inconsistent with this opinion.  And, we remand the case to the Tax Court for further proceedings.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
