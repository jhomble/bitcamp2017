In  March 1992, Barbara  Desouza pled\n                    \n\nguilty  to attempt  and conspiracy  to distribute  cocaine in\n\nviolation of  21 U.S.C.   846.   At sentencing on  August 11,\n\n1992,  she received  a  two-level reduction  in base  offense\n\nlevel  for acceptance  of  responsibility  under  U.S.S.G.   \n\n3E1.1.   She did not appeal her sentence.  Effective November\n\n1, 1992, section  3E1.1 was amended  to permit an  additional\n\none-level reduction in base  offense level for defendants who\n\ntimely plead guilty so  that the government does not  have to\n\nprepare for trial.  After the  amendment, Desouza moved under\n\n28  U.S.C.    2255  to  vacate,  set  aside  or  correct  her\n\nsentence, citing the  change in the guideline.   The district\n\ncourt denied her motion, and she appealed.  We now affirm.\n\n          In United States  v. Havener, 905 F.2d  3 (1st Cir.\n                                      \n\n1990),  we  considered whether  an  amendment  of the  career\n\noffender guideline, U.S.S.G.   4B1.1, could  be retroactively\n\napplied.  The amendment had added a sentence to section 4B1.1\n\nwhich permitted  career offenders  a reduction of  two levels\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility which had not been permitted\n\nunder the preexisting guideline.  We found that the amendment\n\ncould not  be applied retroactively because  the new sentence\n\nwas \"not  clarification; it  [was] change.\"   Id.  at 5.   We\n                                                 \n\nfound  our  conclusion  to  be confirmed  by  the  Sentencing\n\nCommission's  explanation of  the amendment;  its explanation\n\nsuggested that the  amendment was not intended to clarify the\n\n                             -2-\n\nguideline, but to \"authorize\" an acceptance of responsibility\n\ndeduction in  determining  the offense  level  under  section\n\n4B1.1.  In addition, U.S.S.G.   1B1.10(d) lists the guideline\n\namendments intended  to be  retroactive, but did  not include\n\nthe amendment  of section  4B1.1.  Accordingly,  we concluded\n\nthat  the   amended  section  4B1.1  could   not  be  applied\n\nretroactively.  Id.\n                   \n\n          The  analysis  in  Havener  controls   here.    The\n                                    \n\namendment  Desouza   relies  on  is  Amendment   459  to  the\n\nSentencing Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. Manual (1992),  Appendix\n                           \n\nC, at  281-83.  A  review of  that \"amendment\" shows  that it\n\nactually deleted the entire text of the preexisting guideline\n\nand  replaced it  with the  present section  3E1.1.   The new\n\nguideline retained the old two-level reduction for acceptance\n\nof  responsibility, albeit  in modified  form.   In addition,\n\namended section  3E1.1  permitted an  entirely new  one-level\n\nreduction in  offense level for defendants  who qualified for\n\nthe  two-level  reduction,  had an  offense  level  of  16 or\n\ngreater  before the  two-level reduction  was taken,  and had\n\nassisted  authorities in  investigating or  prosecuting their\n\nown  misconduct  by  taking  certain  steps  such  as  timely\n\nnotifying authorities of an intent to enter a guilty plea.\n\n          There is no doubt that Amendment  459 substantively\n\nchanged the preexisting guideline, and did not merely clarify\n\nit,  and  the  Sentencing  Commission's  explanation  of  the\n\n                             -3-\n\npurpose  of  the amendment  confirms  that.   The  Sentencing\n\nCommission stated that the amendment \"provides  an additional\n\nreduction  of   one  level  for   certain  defendants   whose\n\nacceptance  of  responsibility  includes  assistance  to  the\n\ngovernment in  the investigation or prosecution  of their own\n\nmisconduct.\"  Id. at 283.  Although the Sentencing Commission\n                 \n\ncan  designate  a  substantive  change  as  retroactive,  the\n\nSentencing Commission did not include this one in the list of\n\nthose qualifying  for  retroactive application.   U.S.S.G.   \n\nlBl.10(d)  (listing  amendments designated  as retroactive).1\n\nAccordingly, the  district court  had no authority  to modify\n\nDesouza's  sentence even  if  it thought  that Desouza  would\n\nunder the  new version  qualify for the  additional one-level\n\nreduction.  Havener, 905 F.2d at 6-7 (applying this rationale\n                   \n\nto deny retroactive application of an amendment to the career\n\noffender  guideline); see  also United  States v.  Caceda, --\n                                                         \n\nF.2d  --,  1993  WL  98298  (2d  Cir.  1993)  (applying  this\n\nrationale to deny retroactive application of Amendment 459).\n\n          We conclude  that amended section 3E1.1  may not be\n\napplied retroactively  to permit  Desouza an  additional one-\n\n                    \n\n1.  Where the Sentencing  Commission designates a substantive\nchange as  retroactive, the  court \"may\" reduce  a previously\nimposed term  in accordance with the change  if the reduction\nis consistent with general sentencing  factors and applicable\npolicy statements of the Sentencing  Commission.  18 U.S.C.  \n3582(c)(2).  Unless  a request for  a reduction falls  within\nthis  rubric, or one of the other exceptions specified in the\nstatute, the court \"may not modify a term of imprisonment . .\n. .\"  18 U.S.C.   3582(c).\n\n                             -4-\n\nlevel reduction for timely pleading guilty.   The judgment of\n\nthe district court is affirmed.\n                              \n\n                             -5-\n",
