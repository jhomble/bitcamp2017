This diversity case stems from a failed real\n\nestate    transaction      between   Concrete    Systems    Inc.    (\"CSI\")   and\n\nPavestone Co. (\"Pavestone\").         CSI owned a parcel of land on Pierce\n\nAvenue in Lakeville, Massachusetts (\"the property\"), that was\n\nequipped to operate as a concrete plant.                   Pavestone, a Texas\n\ncompany, wished to purchase the property so that it could increase\n\nits concrete business in the region, but after placing a $50,000\n\ndeposit and signing a purchase and sale agreement, Pavestone\n\ndecided that it could not proceed with the closing.\n\n            After the sale fell through, CSI sued Pavestone on three\n\ntheories:     (1) Pavestone breached its obligation to purchase the\n\nproperty (\"failure-to-close claims\"); (2) Pavestone committed acts\n\non the property that resulted in Lakeville's rezoning the property\n\nfrom     industrial   to    residential,       thereby   reducing    its   value\n\n(\"rezoning    claims\");      and   (3)    Pavestone   failed   to   return    the\n\nproperty to its pre-existing condition and failed to return certain\n\nequipment that it removed from the property after it decided not to\n\nclose (\"condition-of-the-property claims\").              The second and third\n\ntheories relate to Pavestone's work on the property during the pre-\n\nclosing period -- a period in which Pavestone was authorized under\n\nthe purchase and sale agreement to perform work on the property.\n\n             In a series of separate rulings, the district court\n\ndismissed the failure-to-close claims, to the extent that they\n\nsought damages in excess of Pavestone's $50,000 deposit, because\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fthe purchase and sale agreement contained a liquidated damages\n\nclause limiting the damages for failing to close to the deposit\n\namount; granted summary judgment on the rezoning claims because CSI\n\ncould not establish that Pavestone's pre-closing work on the\n\nproperty had caused Lakeville to rezone the property; and dismissed\n\nthe condition-of-the-property claims because of CSI's discovery\n\nviolations.   As a result of these rulings, the case went to trial\n\nonly on the failure-to-close claims with a damage cap of $50,000.\n\nAfter a short jury trial, CSI prevailed.\n\n           The district court subsequently entered judgment for CSI\n\nin the amount of $50,000 plus 12 percent prejudgment interest\n\npursuant to Mass. Gen. L. ch. 231, § 6C.   Pavestone then moved to\n\namend this judgment, arguing that it was excessive because CSI had\n\nearned interest on the $50,000 deposit during the prejudgment\n\nperiod.   The court agreed and entered an amended judgment reducing\n\nthe award by the actual amount of interest earned by CSI.      CSI\n\ntimely appealed and now challenges the district court's rulings\n\nlimiting the available damages on the failure-to-close claims,\n\ngranting summary judgment on the rezoning claims, and reducing the\n\namount of prejudgment interest.    We consider these challenges in\n\nturn.\n\n           CSI contends that the district court erred in granting\n\nPavestone's motion to dismiss the failure-to-close claims to the\n\nextent that they sought damages in excess of $50,000.   CSI asserts\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fthat this ruling was inappropriate because the liquidated damages\n\nclause was an affirmative defense, and a court \"may not delve into\n\nthe merits of possible defenses\" at the motion to dismiss stage.\n\nIt further claims that, even if the court could grant such a\n\nmotion, it was wrong to do so in this case.        Our review is de novo.\n\nSee Reppert v. Marvin Lumber & Cedar Co.,           359 F.3d 53, 56 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n            \"[A]n affirmative defense may be adjudicated on a motion\n\nto dismiss for failure to state a claim.\"         In re Colonial Mortgage\n\nBankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 2003); see also Blackstone\n\nRealty LLC v. FDIC, 244 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2001); Cavanagh v.\n\nCavanagh, 489 N.E.2d 671, 673 (Mass. 1986).         So long as the facts\n\nestablishing the defense appear on the face of the complaint and\n\nthe court's review leaves \"no doubt\" that the plaintiff's claim is\n\nbarred by the asserted defense, granting a motion to dismiss is\n\nappropriate.      Blackstone Realty, 244 F.3d at 197.\n\n            The   operative     complaint    included    the   text     of   the\n\nliquidated damages clause and had attached to it a copy of the\n\npurchase and sale agreement containing the clause.               See Stein v.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada, 239 F.3d 389, 392 (1st Cir. 2001) (stating\n\nthat documents attached to the complaint may be considered on a\n\nmotion to dismiss). The facts establishing the existence and scope\n\nof the liquidated damages clause were thus apparent from the face\n\nof   the   complaint.     CSI    contends,    however,    that    the   second\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fBlackstone Realty precondition -- certitude that the defense bars\n\nthe plaintiff's claim -- was not satisfied. See Blackstone Realty,\n\n244 F.3d at 197.       According to CSI, the facts in the complaint were\n\nsufficient to support an argument that Pavestone had waived or was\n\nestopped from asserting the liquidated damages clause as a defense.\n\nCSI argues that the pre-closing work that Pavestone performed on\n\nthe property was so extensive that it represented a decision by\n\nPavestone \"to close by . . . conduct.\"                   Thus, the argument\n\ncontinues, Pavestone's conduct stripped it of \"the right to walk\n\naway for $50,000.\"\n\n              The purchase and sale agreement specifically provided\n\nPavestone     with     pre-closing   access   to   the    property   to    make\n\nimprovements.        While the agreement listed certain contemplated\n\nimprovements, it provided that Pavestone could perform pre-closing\n\nwork \"without limitation.\"           The pre-closing work performed by\n\nPavestone      was   thus     expressly   contemplated    by   the   parties'\n\nagreement.     Pavestone's exercise of its contractual right to work\n\non the property, a right expressly granted by the purchase and sale\n\nagreement, cannot constitute a waiver or estop it from asserting\n\nits   right    under    the    liquidated   damages   clause   of    the   same\n\nagreement.     Thus, the merit of Pavestone's affirmative defense was\n\nobvious at the motion to dismiss stage.1\n\n      1\n      CSI also claims that the district court mistakenly relied on\nthe liquidated damages clause to dismiss the condition-of-the-\nproperty claims. As we understand the record, only the failure-to-\nclose claims in excess of $50,000 were dismissed because of the\n\n                                      -5-\n\f           We turn next to the grant of summary judgment on the\n\nrezoning claims.      We examine the summary judgment record in the\n\nlight most    favorable     to   the   non-moving   party    and   review   the\n\ndistrict court's ruling de novo.         See Alberty-Velez v. Corporacion\n\nDe P.R. Para La Difusion Publica, 361 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           CSI argues that the district court erroneously granted\n\nsummary    judgment    on    the   rezoning    claims       by   ruling     that\n\nMassachusetts law precludes causes of action requiring proof of the\n\nlegislative motive for the enactment of a municipal ordinance.                We\n\nare not so sure that this was the district court's rationale.                The\n\ncourt had before it Pavestone's motion for summary judgment, which\n\nchallenged CSI's rezoning claim as both legally and factually\n\ninsufficient.    The basis for the district court's ruling is not\n\nobvious.   We may affirm, however, for any reason apparent from the\n\nrecord.    See id. at 6.\n\n           CSI focuses on the legal issue presented by Pavestone's\n\nmotion:    whether a claim which requires proof of the legislative\n\nmotivation for an enactment may ever be viable under Massachusetts\n\nlaw.   We will assume arguendo that such a claim is theoretically\n\nviable.    Nevertheless, we affirm because CSI failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that\n\n\n\n\nliquidated damages clause. The remaining claims were disposed of\non other grounds. See supra at 2-3.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fPavestone's conduct was the proximate cause of the town's rezoning\n\ndecision.\n\n            CSI presented the following evidence in opposition to\n\nPavestone's motion:       that Pavestone performed heavy work at the\n\nproperty    without   warning    abutting      landowners;    that   Pavestone\n\nreceived complaints from neighbors about work being performed at\n\nnight and on Sundays, and about heavy truck traffic on residential\n\nstreets; that some Lakeville residents led a campaign opposing\n\nPavestone's    presence     in   the    community;   that    some    Lakeville\n\nresidents filed a petition with the Board of Selectmen seeking to\n\nrezone the property; that the Planning Board subsequently held a\n\nmeeting to address the possibility of rezoning the property, and\n\nthat some local residents spoke negatively about Pavestone at that\n\nmeeting; and that nine days later, at the town meeting, the\n\nresidents of Lakeville voted 88 to 40 to rezone the property.\n\nThere was no evidence, however, as to who actually voted at the\n\ntown meeting or what motivated voters to approve the zoning change.\n\nWe do not know, for instance, whether any of the attendees of the\n\nPlanning Board meeting actually participated in the vote.                Nor do\n\nwe   know   whether   any   of   the    residents    who    complained    about\n\nPavestone's activities actually voted.\n\n            Under Massachusetts law, courts must be circumspect in\n\nattempting to ascertain the legislators' rationale for enacting a\n\nparticular piece of legislation.             As the Supreme Judicial Court\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\frecently explained, such an inquiry is complicated by \"[t]he\n\ndiverse   character    of   [the     legislators']     motives,    and   the\n\nimpossibility   of    penetrating     into   the     hearts   of   men   and\n\nascertaining the truth.\"     Durand v. IDC Bellingham, LLC, 793 N.E.\n\n2d 359, 365 (Mass. 2003) (quoting Boston v. Talbot,           91 N.E. 1014,\n\n1016-17 (Mass. 1910)); see also United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S.\n\n367, 383-84 (1968) (\"Inquiries into [legislative] motives . . . are\n\na hazardous matter. . . .    What motivates one legislator to make a\n\nspeech about a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of\n\nothers to enact it.\").      The Massachusetts Appeals Court also has\n\ncautioned that the pre-enactment history of a town ordinance that\n\ndoes not clearly indicate the motives of the voters is insufficient\n\nto establish the town's rationale for enacting the ordinance.\n\nSouthern New England Conference Ass'n of Seventh-Day Adventists v.\n\nBurlington, 490 N.E. 2d 451, 456 (Mass. App. Ct. 1986).\n\n          As stated above, CSI's evidence could permit a trier of\n\nfact to conclude that the rezoning change was made after Pavestone\n\nworked on the property and some members of the community complained\n\nabout Pavestone's conduct.         CSI presented no evidence, however,\n\nconnecting Pavestone's conduct or the citizen complaints to the\n\nactual motivations of the voters who voted to rezone the property.\n\nMassachusetts courts recognize that voters often cast their ballots\n\nbased on \"irrelevant considerations,\" or at least for reasons other\n\nthan those at the forefront of pre-balloting discussions.                Id.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fGiven the Massachusetts courts' reluctance to engage in surmise\n\nover legislative motivation, CSI's anecdotal evidence identifying\n\nthe concerns of some community members (who may not have even voted\n\nat the town meeting) is insufficient proof from which a trier of\n\nfact       could conclude that the proximate cause of the voters'\n\ndecision to rezone the property was Pavestone's allegedly wrongful\n\nconduct.     Cf. Pheasant Ridge Assocs. Ltd. v. Burlington, 506 N.E.\n\n2d 1152, 1156 (Mass. 1987) (affirming judicial determination that\n\ntown's exercise of its eminent domain power was in bad faith\n\nbecause the evidence of bad faith was essentially undisputed, but\n\nnoting that courts \"should not easily attribute . . . motives to a\n\ntown, and to its citizens voting at town meeting\").\n\n             Finally, we consider CSI's challenge to the district\n\ncourt's decision reducing the prejudgment interest award to exclude\n\nthe interest that CSI actually earned on the $50,000 deposit during\n\nthe prejudgment period.     CSI argues that the district court erred\n\nby reducing the prejudgment interest award because \"Massachusetts\n\ncourts have almost no discretion\" to make such reductions.2\n\n\n       2\n      Before discussing the merits of this argument, we dispose of\nCSI's assertion that the district court lacked jurisdiction to\nconsider this issue because Pavestone's motion to alter or amend\nthe judgment was untimely. A party has ten days to file a motion\nto alter or amend judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), and this\nperiod may not be extended.     See generally García-Velazquez v.\nFrito Lay Snacks Caribbean, 358 F.3d 6, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2004). The\nten-day period does not include weekends and holidays. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 6(a). Judgment entered on November 14, 2003, and Pavestone\nfiled its motion on November 25, 2003. Not including weekends,\nPavestone's motion was filed within ten days after judgment entered\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            Under the Massachusetts interest statute, prejudgment\n\ninterest in a contract action is usually computed at the contract\n\nrate, if established, or otherwise at 12 percent.      See   Mass. Gen.\n\nL. ch. 231, § 6C.       The Supreme Judicial Court has interpreted the\n\nstatute to grant courts discretion to assure that interest awards\n\ndo not result in \"windfall[s] for plaintiffs.\"      Sterilite Corp. v.\n\nContinental Cas. Co., 494 N.E. 2d 1008, 1011 (Mass. 1986).         The\n\npurpose of prejudgment interest is to compensate a wronged party\n\nfor the loss of the use of money, and the award should reflect this\n\npurpose.    Id.\n\n            Here, CSI earned interest on the $50,000 award during the\n\nprejudgment period because it held the deposit in an interest-\n\nbearing account.     If CSI were able to retain this interest and\n\nreceive the entire 12 percent interest award available under the\n\nstatute, it would receive a windfall because it was able to benefit\n\nfrom the $50,000 deposit during the prejudgment period.            The\n\ndistrict court acted within the wide ambit of its discretion in\n\ntailoring the interest award so as to avoid bestowing a windfall\n\nupon CSI.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nand was therefore timely.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

CSI asserts\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fthat this ruling was inappropriate because the liquidated damages\n\nclause was an affirmative defense, and a court \"may not delve into\n\nthe merits of possible defenses\" at the motion to dismiss stage.\n\nIt further claims that, even if the court could grant such a\n\nmotion, it was wrong to do so in this case.

See Stein v.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199275\"><a href=\"/opinion/199275/stein-v-royal-bank-of-canada/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 392 (1st Cir. 2001) (stating\n\nthat documents attached to the complaint may be considered on a\n\nmotion to dismiss). The facts establishing the existence and scope\n\nof the liquidated damages clause were thus apparent from the face\n\nof   the   complaint.     CSI    contends,    however,    that    the   second\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fBlackstone Realty precondition -- certitude that the defense bars\n\nthe plaintiff's claim -- was not satisfied. See Blackstone Realty,\n\n244 F.3d at 197.       According to CSI, the facts in the complaint were\n\nsufficient to support an argument that Pavestone had waived or was\n\nestopped from asserting the liquidated damages clause as a defense.\n\nCSI argues that the pre-closing work that Pavestone performed on\n\nthe property was so extensive that it represented a decision by\n\nPavestone \"to close by . . . conduct.\"                   Thus, the argument\n\ncontinues, Pavestone's conduct stripped it of \"the right to walk\n\naway for $50,000.\"\n\n              The purchase and sale agreement specifically provided\n\nPavestone     with     pre-closing   access   to   the    property   to    make\n\nimprovements.        While the agreement listed certain contemplated\n\nimprovements, it provided that Pavestone could perform pre-closing\n\nwork \"without limitation.\"           The pre-closing work performed by\n\nPavestone      was   thus     expressly   contemplated    by   the   parties'\n\nagreement.     Pavestone's exercise of its contractual right to work\n\non the property, a right expressly granted by the purchase and sale\n\nagreement, cannot constitute a waiver or estop it from asserting\n\nits   right    under    the    liquidated   damages   clause   of    the   same\n\nagreement.     Thus, the merit of Pavestone's affirmative defense was\n\nobvious at the motion to dismiss stage.1\n\n      1\n      CSI also claims that the district court mistakenly relied on\nthe liquidated damages clause to dismiss the condition-of-the-\nproperty claims. As we understand the record, only the failure-to-\nclose claims in excess of $50,000 were dismissed because of the\n\n                                      -5-\n\f           We turn next to the grant of summary judgment on the\n\nrezoning claims.      We examine the summary judgment record in the\n\nlight most    favorable     to   the   non-moving   party    and   review   the\n\ndistrict court's ruling de novo.         See Alberty-Velez v.

We\n\nare not so sure that this was the district court's rationale.                The\n\ncourt had before it Pavestone's motion for summary judgment, which\n\nchallenged CSI's rezoning claim as both legally and factually\n\ninsufficient.    The basis for the district court's ruling is not\n\nobvious.   We may affirm, however, for any reason apparent from the\n\nrecord.    See id. at 6.\n\n           CSI focuses on the legal issue presented by Pavestone's\n\nmotion:    whether a claim which requires proof of the legislative\n\nmotivation for an enactment may ever be viable under Massachusetts\n\nlaw.   We will assume arguendo that such a claim is theoretically\n\nviable.    Nevertheless, we affirm because CSI failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that\n\n\n\n\nliquidated damages clause. The remaining claims were disposed of\non other grounds. See supra at 2-3.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fPavestone's conduct was the proximate cause of the town's rezoning\n\ndecision.\n\n            CSI presented the following evidence in opposition to\n\nPavestone's motion:       that Pavestone performed heavy work at the\n\nproperty    without   warning    abutting      landowners;    that   Pavestone\n\nreceived complaints from neighbors about work being performed at\n\nnight and on Sundays, and about heavy truck traffic on residential\n\nstreets; that some Lakeville residents led a campaign opposing\n\nPavestone's    presence     in   the    community;   that    some    Lakeville\n\nresidents filed a petition with the Board of Selectmen seeking to\n\nrezone the property; that the Planning Board subsequently held a\n\nmeeting to address the possibility of rezoning the property, and\n\nthat some local residents spoke negatively about Pavestone at that\n\nmeeting; and that nine days later, at the town meeting, the\n\nresidents of Lakeville voted 88 to 40 to rezone the property.\n\nThere was no evidence, however, as to who actually voted at the\n\ntown meeting or what motivated voters to approve the zoning change.\n\nWe do not know, for instance, whether any of the attendees of the\n\nPlanning Board meeting actually participated in the vote.                Nor do\n\nwe   know   whether   any   of   the    residents    who    complained    about\n\nPavestone's activities actually voted.\n\n            Under Massachusetts law, courts must be circumspect in\n\nattempting to ascertain the legislators' rationale for enacting a\n\nparticular piece of legislation.             As the Supreme Judicial Court\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\frecently explained, such an inquiry is complicated by \"[t]he\n\ndiverse   character    of   [the     legislators']     motives,    and   the\n\nimpossibility   of    penetrating     into   the     hearts   of   men   and\n\nascertaining the truth.\"     Durand v.

The Massachusetts Appeals Court also has\n\ncautioned that the pre-enactment history of a town ordinance that\n\ndoes not clearly indicate the motives of the voters is insufficient\n\nto establish the town's rationale for enacting the ordinance.\n\nSouthern New England Conference Ass'n of Seventh-Day Adventists v.\n\nBurlington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251377\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251377/southern-new-england-conf-assn-v-burlington/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 456 (Mass. App. Ct. 1986).\n\n          As stated above, CSI's evidence could permit a trier of\n\nfact to conclude that the rezoning change was made after Pavestone\n\nworked on the property and some members of the community complained\n\nabout Pavestone's conduct.         CSI presented no evidence, however,\n\nconnecting Pavestone's conduct or the citizen complaints to the\n\nactual motivations of the voters who voted to rezone the property.\n\nMassachusetts courts recognize that voters often cast their ballots\n\nbased on \"irrelevant considerations,\" or at least for reasons other\n\nthan those at the forefront of pre-balloting discussions.                Id.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fGiven the Massachusetts courts' reluctance to engage in surmise\n\nover legislative motivation, CSI's anecdotal evidence identifying\n\nthe concerns of some community members (who may not have even voted\n\nat the town meeting) is insufficient proof from which a trier of\n\nfact       could conclude that the proximate cause of the voters'\n\ndecision to rezone the property was Pavestone's allegedly wrongful\n\nconduct.     Cf. Pheasant Ridge Assocs. Ltd. v. Burlington, 506 N.E.\n\n2d 1152, 1156 (Mass. 1987) (affirming judicial determination that\n\ntown's exercise of its eminent domain power was in bad faith\n\nbecause the evidence of bad faith was essentially undisputed, but\n\nnoting that courts \"should not easily attribute . . . motives to a\n\ntown, and to its citizens voting at town meeting\").\n\n             Finally, we consider CSI's challenge to the district\n\ncourt's decision reducing the prejudgment interest award to exclude\n\nthe interest that CSI actually earned on the $50,000 deposit during\n\nthe prejudgment period.     CSI argues that the district court erred\n\nby reducing the prejudgment interest award because \"Massachusetts\n\ncourts have almost no discretion\" to make such reductions.2\n\n\n       2\n      Before discussing the merits of this argument, we dispose of\nCSI's assertion that the district court lacked jurisdiction to\nconsider this issue because Pavestone's motion to alter or amend\nthe judgment was untimely. A party has ten days to file a motion\nto alter or amend judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), and this\nperiod may not be extended.

See   Mass. Gen.\n\nL. ch. 231, § 6C.       The Supreme Judicial Court has interpreted the\n\nstatute to grant courts discretion to assure that interest awards\n\ndo not result in \"windfall[s] for plaintiffs.\"      Sterilite Corp. v.\n\nContinental Cas.

Id.\n\n            Here, CSI earned interest on the $50,000 award during the\n\nprejudgment period because it held the deposit in an interest-\n\nbearing account.     If CSI were able to retain this interest and\n\nreceive the entire 12 percent interest award available under the\n\nstatute, it would receive a windfall because it was able to benefit\n\nfrom the $50,000 deposit during the prejudgment period.
