Hall,  Jr., pro se on Application  for Certificate\n                                 \nof Probable Cause and brief.\n\n                                          \n\n                        February 18, 1993\n                                          \n\n     Per Curiam.  Pro se petitioner Herman Hall, a  Massachusetts\n                        \n\ninmate,  seeks a  certificate  of probable  cause  to appeal  the\n\ndismissal of his second petition for habeas corpus.  The district\n\ncourt  adopted  the  recommendation  of a  magistrate  judge  and\n\ndismissed the habeas petition  on the ground that Hall  failed to\n\nexhaust his state remedies.  In so doing, the court relied on the\n\nfact that Hall  had previously  filed a  similar habeas  petition\n\nthat  was dismissed for nonexhaustion.  For the reasons discussed\n\nbelow,  we grant the certificate of probable cause and vacate the\n\ndismissal.   We remand  for  consideration of  the issue  whether\n\nexhaustion has  obtained as  a result of  certain post-conviction\n\nmotions that Hall filed in state court.\n\n                                I.\n\n     On July 29, 1988,  Hall was convicted by a  Suffolk Superior\n\nCourt jury of  larceny of  a motor vehicle  and burning  personal\n\nproperty.    The charges  arose from  Hall's  alleged theft  of a\n\nCadillac from  the  victims, Earl  Fisher  and his  mother,  Lula\n\nFisher,  between January  3-6, 1988.   The  Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt  affirmed   Hall's  conviction  on  direct   appeal  in  an\n\nunpublished decision.   See Commonwealth v. Herman  H. Hall, Jr.,\n                                                                \n\n28  Mass.  App.  Ct.  1111  (1990).    On  March  28,  1990,  the\n\nMassachusetts   Supreme  Judicial   Court  (SJC)   denied  Hall's\n\napplication for further \n\nappellate review. See 407  Mass. 1101 (1990).1   Hall then turned\n                     \n\n                    \n\n     1We note that Hall, who was represented by appointed counsel\nat   trial  and  on  appeal,   filed  pro  se   briefs  with  the\n                                             \nMassachusetts  Appeals Court  and Supreme  Judicial Court  (SJC).\nThe Appeals Court considered and rejected the arguments raised in\nHall's pro se brief in its decision  affirming Hall's conviction.\n             \n\nto federal court.\n\n     Hall  filed his first  habeas corpus petition  in June 1990.\n\nThe  petition,  supplemented  by  multiple  filings,  raised five\n\nclaims:\n\n     (1)    that  Hall's conviction  resulted  from evidence\n     gained in an unconstitutional search and seizure (i.e.,\n     the VX-829 registration);\n\n     (2)   that Earl Fisher and another man conspired to \"do\n     an insurance job\"  on the  car, and, with  the help  of\n     officials  from  the  Boston  Fire  Department's  Arson\n     Squad, framed Hall;\n\n     (3)  that Hall was unlawfully arrested in Providence by\n     Boston Arson Squad officers who, in addition to lacking\n     probable  cause,  had  no territorial  jurisdiction  to\n     arrest Hall;\n\n     (4)  that  the district attorney tricked  the jury into\n     believing  that Hall stole  the car and \"re-registered\"\n     it in Rhode  Island when,  in fact, the  car was  never\n     \"re-registered.\"    Hall  alleged that  the  prosecutor\n     deliberately  misrepresented  the facts  concerning the\n     car's registrations.\n\n     (5)  ineffective assistance of counsel based on defense\n     counsel's failure  to (a)  move to suppress  the VX-829\n     registration evidence, (b)  challenge the lawfulness of\n     Hall's  arrest, (c)  call  certain witnesses,  and  (d)\n     impeach Earl Fisher.  Hall also complained that defense\n     counsel helped the district attorney cover-up the Arson\n     Squad's misconduct.2\n\nThe respondent filed an  answer which raised nonexhaustion, inter\n                                                                 \n\nalia,  as an affirmative defense.   This defense was specifically\n    \n\n                    \n\nThe SJC did not consider Hall's pro se brief; rather, that  court\n                                      \nreturned  Hall's brief  to him  while advising  Hall to  have his\ncounsel raise his claims.\n\n     2In addition to the five claims  enumerated above, Hall also\nalleged that the only  black juror was \"terrorized\" and  that the\nprosecution unlawfully erased portions  of the tape recordings of\nHall's probable cause hearing.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\npredicated on the  assertion that  none of  Hall's habeas  claims\n\nwere raised in Hall's direct criminal appeal.  The district court\n\nadopted the  recommendation of  a magistrate judge  and dismissed\n\nHall's habeas petition because none of his claims had been raised\n\nin  Hall's application for further appellate review.  See Mele v.\n                                                              \n\nFitchburg Dist. Court, 850 F.2d 817, 823 (1st  Cir. 1988)(holding\n                     \n\n\"that  an  appealed issue  cannot  be considered  as  having been\n\nfairly  presented to the  SJC for exhaustion  purposes unless the\n\napplicant  has  raised  it   within  the  four  corners  of   the\n\n[application  for further  appellate  review]\").3   The  district\n\ncourt granted Hall's request for a certificate of probable cause,\n\nbut  his  appeal  from  this dismissal  order  was  dismissed  as\n\nuntimely.  Undaunted,  Hall filed a  second habeas petition  with\n\nthe district court.   This second petition essentially reiterated\n\nthe five claims identified above, although the petitions  are not\n\nidentical twins.4     \n\n       A  different  magistrate  judge  recommended  that  Hall's\n\nsecond habeas  petition be summarily dismissed  because it raised\n\nthe same claims as his first and Hall still had failed to exhaust\n\n                    \n\n     3While   the  district   court  did   not  identify   Hall's\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, its finding that none of\nHall's habeas claims were  raised within the four corners  of his\napplication for further appellate review remains correct.    \n\n     4Hall's second habeas petition did  not allege that the lone\nblack juror had  been terrorized,  nor that  the prosecution  had\nerased any tapes.  The second habeas petition also challenged the\nsufficiency of the evidence at Hall's trial, a claim that was not\npresented in his first petition.    \n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nhis  state  remedies.       The   district  court  adopted   this\n\nrecommendation and  dismissed  the petition.5    Thereafter,  the\n\ncourt denied Hall's  request for a certificate  of probable cause\n\non the same nonexhaustion ground.  Hall has filed a timely notice\n\nof appeal and request for a certificate of probable cause.\n\n                               II.\n\n     In answering a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C.  2254,\n\nthe respondent is required to  \"state whether the petitioner  has\n\nexhausted  his  state   remedies  including  any  post-conviction\n                                                                 \n\nremedies available to him under the  statutes or procedural rules\n                                                                 \n\nof the state and including also his right of appeal both from the\n                                                                 \n\njudgment  of conviction and from any adverse judgment or order in\n                                                                 \n\nthe  post-conviction  proceeding.\"    See  Rule  5  of  the Rules\n                                         \n\nGoverning  Section  2254  Cases  in the  United  States  District\n\nCourts.  (emphasis supplied).    The record  indicates that  Hall\n\nfiled  two pro  se post-conviction  motions in  the Massachusetts\n                  \n\nsuperior  court before his direct appeal was resolved.  The first\n\nof these raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which\n\nthe trial court  denied on  the merits and  Hall did not  appeal.\n\nHall's  second post-conviction  motion  (titled  \"Motion for  new\n\ntrial/newly discovered evidence\") raised  Hall's unconstitutional\n\n                    \n\n     5This dismissal order  was entered before  Hall's objections\nto  the magistrate  judge's  report were  filed.   However,  that\nreport gave Hall ten days from his receipt of the report in which\n                                          \nto  file his objections.   Hall filed his  objections on April 6,\n1992,  within  the  requisite  ten days  (excluding  weekends  as\nrequired by Fed. R. Civ.  P. 6(a)) of his alleged receipt  of the\nreport on March 25, 1992.\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\narrest  and  search  and  seizure  claims,  as  well  as  a  less\n\nintelligible claim that Hall  could not show his evidence  to the\n\njury.6   This motion  also was  denied by the  trial judge.   The\n\nrecord indicates  that Hall filed a pro  se notice of appeal from\n                                           \n\nthis ruling, but no disposition of this appeal is recorded.  From\n\nall that appears in the record, it may still be pending.   \n\n     \"'[I]n  determining  whether  a   remedy  for  a  particular\n\nconstitutional  claim  is  \"available,\"  the federal  courts  are\n\nauthorized,  indeed required,  to  assess the  likelihood that  a\n\nstate  court will accord the  habeas petitioner a  hearing on the\n\nmerits of his  claim.'\" Carsetti  v. Maine, 932  F.2d 1007,  1012\n                                          \n\n(1st  Cir. 1991)  (quoting  Harris v.  Reed, 109  S. Ct.  at 1046\n                                           \n\n(O'Connor, J.,  concurring)).  Because the  respondent overlooked\n\nHall's post-conviction  motions in its original  answer to Hall's\n\nfirst  habeas petition, the district court was not able to assess\n\nthe likelihood that exhaustion  has obtained through Hall's post-\n\nconviction  motions.  Yet  it appears likely  that exhaustion has\n\nobtained, if not through Hall's actual presentation of his habeas\n\nclaims to the  state courts,  then by a  procedural default.   We\n\nexplain.\n\n     \"[T]he exhaustion  doctrine requires that a  state defendant\n\nseeking to overturn his conviction on federal grounds first  must\n\n                    \n\n     6Our descriptions of the substance of Hall's post-conviction\nmotions  are drawn  from his  habeas petitions.  Their procedural\nhistory  in the  state  court is  disclosed by  the Massachusetts\nsuperior court  docket sheet appended to  the government's answer\nto Hall's first habeas petition.\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\ngive  the  state  courts 'a  fair  opportunity'  to consider  his\n\nclaims.  (citation omitted).   This means that  the habeas corpus\n\npetitioner  must  have presented  the  substance  of his  federal\n\nconstitutional claim to  the state appellate  courts so that  the\n\nstate had the first chance  to correct the claimed constitutional\n\nerror.\"  Lanigan  v. Maloney, 853  F.2d 40,  42 (1st Cir.  1988),\n                            \n\ncert. denied, 488 U.S.  1007 (1989).  However, exhaustion  may be\n            \n\nfound  even where the  habeas petitioner has  never presented his\n\nfederal claims to state court.  Such would be the case if, at the\n\ntime the habeas petition  was filed, there was no  longer a state\n\nremedy available due to the petitioner's procedural default. \n\n     \"[A] federal  habeas court need  not require that  a federal\n\nclaim be presented to a state court if it is clear that the state\n\ncourt would hold the claim procedurally barred.\"  Harris v. Reed,\n                                                                \n\n489 U.S. 255,  263 n. 9  (1989).  Where  exhaustion has  obtained\n\nthrough  a procedural  default, the  habeas petitioner  must show\n\ncause for that default and prejudice arising therefrom before the\n\nfederal court may reach  the merits of  his habeas claims.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Teague v.  Lane, 489  U.S. 288, 298  (1989); cf. Church  v.\n                                                             \n\nSullivan, 942 F.2d 1501, 1507 n.5 (10th Cir. 1991).  In the usual\n        \n\ncase, victims of  a fundamental miscarriage of  justice will meet\n\nthe \"cause plus prejudice\" test.  See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n478,  495-96 (1986).  However, in  those rare cases where that is\n\nnot so,  a  federal  habeas  court may  consider  a  procedurally\n\ndefaulted  claim absent a showing  of cause for  the default only\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nwhere the  petitioner demonstrates that his  is an \"extraordinary\n\ncase, where  a constitutional violation has  probably resulted in\n\nthe conviction of one  who is actually innocent....\" Id.  at 496;\n                                                        \n\nThigpen v. Thigpen, 926 F.2d 1003, 1010 n. 17 (11th Cir. 1991). \n                  \n\n     Assuming that  neither of Hall's post-conviction motions can\n\nbe fairly said to have raised his  federal habeas claims, Hall is\n\nnow in the  position of  having to file  a third  post-conviction\n\nmotion in  state  court.   Under  Massachusetts law,  a  criminal\n\ndefendant  may file  a motion  for post-conviction relief  at any\n\ntime,  however any grounds not raised in a defendant's first such\n\nmotion  are  waived unless  (a)  the  trial  judge exercises  his\n\ndiscretion to allow said grounds to be heard on  their merits, or\n\n(b)  the defendant  shows  that  the  new  grounds  raised  in  a\n\nsuccessive post-conviction  motion could not have  been raised in\n\nhis first motion.  See Massachusetts R.  Crim. P. 30.  As most of\n                      \n\nthe  evidence Hall has submitted in support of his claims appears\n\nto  have  been available  to him  when he  filed his  first post-\n\nconviction motion, it appears likely that he will be held to have\n\nwaived  his habeas  claims upon  filing a  third motion  with the\n\nsuperior court.   See,  e.g., Commonwealth v.  Deeran, 397  Mass.\n                                                     \n\n136,  139  (1986)(\"[A]  defendant   must  assert  all  reasonably\n\navailable grounds for post-conviction relief in his first rule 30\n\nmotion,  or those  claims  are lost....This  waiver rule  applies\n\nequally to  constitutional claims  which could have  been raised,\n\nbut    were   not    raised,   in   the    defendant's   original\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nmotion.\")(internal  citations  omitted).   If the  district court\n\nconcludes  that the Massachusetts  courts are likely  to so hold,\n\nstate  review  on the  merits would  no  longer be  available and\n\nexhaustion  could be found. See,  e.g., Engle v.  Isaac, 456 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n107, 125-26 n. 28 (1982).   If exhaustion obtains through such  a\n\nprocedural default, then Hall must show cause for his default and\n\nprejudice arising  therefrom before the district  court may reach\n\nthe merits of  his claims.   Alternatively, he  must show that  a\n\nconstitutional  violation has resulted  in his conviction despite\n\nhis innocence.\n\n     On  the  other  hand,  a  finding  that  Hall  has  actually\n\nexhausted his  state remedies may  be warranted if  Hall's second\n\npost-conviction motion  raised his  habeas claims and  his appeal\n\nfrom  the denial of that  motion has remained  pending since 1988\n\nwithout  justification.

Pro se petitioner Herman Hall, a  Massachusetts\n                        \n\ninmate,  seeks a  certificate  of probable  cause  to appeal  the\n\ndismissal of his second petition for habeas corpus.  The district\n\ncourt  adopted  the  recommendation  of a  magistrate  judge  and\n\ndismissed the habeas petition  on the ground that Hall  failed to\n\nexhaust his state remedies.  In so doing, the court relied on the\n\nfact that Hall  had previously  filed a  similar habeas  petition\n\nthat  was dismissed for nonexhaustion.  For the reasons discussed\n\nbelow,  we grant the certificate of probable cause and vacate the\n\ndismissal.   We remand  for  consideration of  the issue  whether\n\nexhaustion has  obtained as  a result of  certain post-conviction\n\nmotions that Hall filed in state court.\n\n                                I.\n\n     On July 29, 1988,  Hall was convicted by a  Suffolk Superior\n\nCourt jury of  larceny of  a motor vehicle  and burning  personal\n\nproperty.    The charges  arose from  Hall's  alleged theft  of a\n\nCadillac from  the  victims, Earl  Fisher  and his  mother,  Lula\n\nFisher,  between January  3-6, 1988.   The  Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt  affirmed   Hall's  conviction  on  direct   appeal  in  an\n\nunpublished decision.   See Commonwealth v. Herman  H. Hall, Jr.,\n                                                                \n\n28  Mass.  App.  Ct.  1111  (1990).

Hall also complained that defense\n     counsel helped the district attorney cover-up the Arson\n     Squad's misconduct.2\n\nThe respondent filed an  answer which raised nonexhaustion, inter\n                                                                 \n\nalia,  as an affirmative defense.   This defense was specifically\n    \n\n                    \n\nThe SJC did not consider Hall's pro se brief; rather, that  court\n                                      \nreturned  Hall's brief  to him  while advising  Hall to  have his\ncounsel raise his claims.\n\n     2In addition to the five claims  enumerated above, Hall also\nalleged that the only  black juror was \"terrorized\" and  that the\nprosecution unlawfully erased portions  of the tape recordings of\nHall's probable cause hearing.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\npredicated on the  assertion that  none of  Hall's habeas  claims\n\nwere raised in Hall's direct criminal appeal.  The district court\n\nadopted the  recommendation of  a magistrate judge  and dismissed\n\nHall's habeas petition because none of his claims had been raised\n\nin  Hall's application for further appellate review.

Undaunted,  Hall filed a  second habeas petition  with\n\nthe district court.   This second petition essentially reiterated\n\nthe five claims identified above, although the petitions  are not\n\nidentical twins.4     \n\n       A  different  magistrate  judge  recommended  that  Hall's\n\nsecond habeas  petition be summarily dismissed  because it raised\n\nthe same claims as his first and Hall still had failed to exhaust\n\n                    \n\n     3While   the  district   court  did   not  identify   Hall's\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, its finding that none of\nHall's habeas claims were  raised within the four corners  of his\napplication for further appellate review remains correct.    \n\n     4Hall's second habeas petition did  not allege that the lone\nblack juror had  been terrorized,  nor that  the prosecution  had\nerased any tapes.

The record  indicates that  Hall\n\nfiled  two pro  se post-conviction  motions in  the Massachusetts\n                  \n\nsuperior  court before his direct appeal was resolved.  The first\n\nof these raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which\n\nthe trial court  denied on  the merits and  Hall did not  appeal.\n\nHall's  second post-conviction  motion  (titled  \"Motion for  new\n\ntrial/newly discovered evidence\") raised  Hall's unconstitutional\n\n                    \n\n     5This dismissal order  was entered before  Hall's objections\nto  the magistrate  judge's  report were  filed.

Hall filed his  objections on April 6,\n1992,  within  the  requisite  ten days  (excluding  weekends  as\nrequired by Fed. R. Civ.  P. 6(a)) of his alleged receipt  of the\nreport on March 25, 1992.\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\narrest  and  search  and  seizure  claims,  as  well  as  a  less\n\nintelligible claim that Hall  could not show his evidence  to the\n\njury.6   This motion  also was  denied by the  trial judge.   The\n\nrecord indicates  that Hall filed a pro  se notice of appeal from\n                                           \n\nthis ruling, but no disposition of this appeal is recorded.

Under  Massachusetts law,  a  criminal\n\ndefendant  may file  a motion  for post-conviction relief  at any\n\ntime,  however any grounds not raised in a defendant's first such\n\nmotion  are  waived unless  (a)  the  trial  judge exercises  his\n\ndiscretion to allow said grounds to be heard on  their merits, or\n\n(b)  the defendant  shows  that  the  new  grounds  raised  in  a\n\nsuccessive post-conviction  motion could not have  been raised in\n\nhis first motion.  See Massachusetts R.  Crim. P. 30.  As most of\n                      \n\nthe  evidence Hall has submitted in support of his claims appears\n\nto  have  been available  to him  when he  filed his  first post-\n\nconviction motion, it appears likely that he will be held to have\n\nwaived  his habeas  claims upon  filing a  third motion  with the\n\nsuperior court.   See,  e.g., Commonwealth v.  Deeran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251464\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251464/commonwealth-v-deeran/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span>\n                                                     \n\n<span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  139  (1986)(\"[A]  defendant   must  assert  all  reasonably\n\navailable grounds for post-conviction relief in his first rule 30\n\nmotion,  or those  claims  are lost....This  waiver rule  applies\n\nequally to  constitutional claims  which could have  been raised,\n\nbut    were   not    raised,   in   the    defendant's   original\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nmotion.\")(internal  citations  omitted).   If the  district court\n\nconcludes  that the Massachusetts  courts are likely  to so hold,\n\nstate  review  on the  merits would  no  longer be  available and\n\nexhaustion  could be found. See,  e.g., Engle v.  Isaac, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110692\"><a href=\"/opinion/110692/engle-v-isaac/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n                                                       \n\n<span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125-26 n. 28 (1982).   If exhaustion obtains through such  a\n\nprocedural default, then Hall must show cause for his default and\n\nprejudice arising  therefrom before the district  court may reach\n\nthe merits of  his claims.   Alternatively, he  must show that  a\n\nconstitutional  violation has resulted  in his conviction despite\n\nhis innocence.\n\n     On  the  other  hand,  a  finding  that  Hall  has  actually\n\nexhausted his  state remedies may  be warranted if  Hall's second\n\npost-conviction motion  raised his  habeas claims and  his appeal\n\nfrom  the denial of that  motion has remained  pending since 1988\n\nwithout  justification.  See Dixon v.

Alternatively, we note that\n\nHall submitted pro  se briefs to the  Massachusetts Appeals Court\n                      \n\n(which considered  and rejected his  claims) and  to the  Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (which apparently  did not consider Hall's claims,\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nbut rather  mailed Hall's brief  back to him).   If  these briefs\n\nwere submitted  in connection  with Hall's appeal  on his  second\n\npost-conviction motion and raised Hall's habeas claims, then Hall\n\ncould  be held to have exhausted his state remedies by submitting\n\na pro  se brief to the SJC.   See Mele v.  Fitchburg Dist. Court,\n                                                                \n\n850 F.2d at 820, (habeas petitioner \"must  fairly present - or do\n                                                                 \n\nhis  best to  present  -  \"  habeas  claims  to  state's  highest\n                     \n\ncourt)(emphasis  supplied).    After  all,  exhaustion  does  not\n\nrequire  that the  SJC have  addressed or decided  Hall's federal\n\nclaims. See Gagne v.
