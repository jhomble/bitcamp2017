Murphy contends that he was\n\nduped into  investing more than  $200,000 in  AFG under  the\n\nfalse  belief that AFG was  licensed to operate a television\n\nstation  in Arecibo,  Puerto  Rico.   Plaintiff's  complaint\n\nasserted  claims  for  compensatory and  treble  damages  in\n\n                    \n\n1  The legal  relationship  between Murphy  and Benevest  is\nunclear.    Benevest is  identified  in the  complaint  as a\ncorporation  incorporated under  the  laws of  Massachusetts\nand, yet, the briefs filed with this  court strongly suggest\nthat Benevest is  not an  entity separate from  Murphy.   On\nappeal Murphy  and Benevest have been treated as one entity;\nthis  conclusion, however,  does not  affect the  outcome of\nthis appeal.  \n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nexcess  of  $5,000,000 under  the  Racketeer Influenced  and\n\nCorrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C.   1961 et. seq. and the\n\nCivil  Code  of Puerto  Rico.    The complaint  also  sought\n\n$300,000 for costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees.  \n\n  On November  21, 1991, defendants sought  an order of  the\n\ncourt pursuant  to Rule 304  requiring plaintiff  to post  a\n\nnon-resident bond in  the amount of  $500,000 to secure  any\n\naward to defendants of costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees.\n\nDefendants also informed the court that they planned to move\n\nto dismiss the action as res judicata.  The motion, however,\n                                     \n\nwas  never filed or decided.   Rule 304  states, in relevant\n\npart:\n\n  When the plaintiff is  domiciled outside of Puerto Rico\n  or is a foreign  corporation, a bond shall be  required\n  to secure the costs,  expenses and attorneys' fees that\n  may be awarded.   All proceedings in the action  may be\n  stayed until  bond is posted,  which shall not  be less\n  than $250.00.  The Court may require an additional bond\n  upon a showing that the original bond is not sufficient\n  security,  and may  stay the  proceeding in  the action\n  until such additional bond is given.\n\n  After  the lapse of sixty (60) days from the service of\n  the  order requiring  bond or additional  bond, without\n  bond  having been  posted,  the Court  may dismiss  the\n  action.\n\n  This rule  shall be  liberally interpreted in  favor of\n                                                         \n  the  plaintiff so as not  to preclude his  right to sue\n                                                         \n  through  excessive bond  requirement.   Consistent with\n                                       \n  this,  the Court,  for good  cause shown,  may dispense\n  with this requirement.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nD.P.R.L.R. 304 (emphasis added).  Murphy opposed the motion,\n\narguing  that  the  bond  request was  excessive  and  would\n\npreclude  him from  pursuing this  action given  his limited\n\nfinancial resources.  \n\n  On December 20, 1991, the district court issued a  summary\n\norder  requiring  Murphy to  post a  bond  in the  amount of\n\n$75,000 within  90 days;  failure to  comply with the  order\n\nwould  result in the  action being dismissed.   Murphy filed\n\ntwo motions for reconsideration  in which he complained that\n\nhe had been unable  to obtain the requisite bond  because he\n\nhad neither  sufficient income  nor valuable  property; that\n\nthe  $75,000 security  bond  was excessive;  that the  court\n\nfailed to evaluate his ability to post the bond; and that as\n\na result of the court's  order he was \"economically helpless\n\nto  pursue  a bonafide  [sic]  claim  before this  Honorable\n\nCourt.\"    The  district   court  denied  both  motions  for\n\nreconsideration   and   ultimately  dismissed   the  action,\n\nreasoning:\n\n  We  note,  at the  onset that  plaintiff is  suing over\n  sixteen  defendants, raising  complex claims  under the\n  RICO  statute,  breach  of  contract  and tort  claims.\n  Inasmuch as  plaintiff is asking $300,000  to cover his\n  own costs, expenses, and attorney's fees, it should not\n  be  out of line  to consider  that defendants  would be\n  expected to incur in [sic] similar expenses.  Plaintiff\n  does not deny that he was a party to the Superior court\n  cases  upon which  defendants  will  move  for  summary\n  judgment; rather,  he asks that we  order defendants to\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n  provide  him  with   certified  transcripts  of   those\n  proceedings, as if they were never there.\n\nMurphy timely filed a notice of appeal from the dismissal.\n\nANALYSIS\n        \n\n  The  purpose of Rule  304 is  to ensure  that a prevailing\n\nparty will be  able to  collect a judicial  award of  costs,\n\nexpenses, and attorneys' fees  from a non-resident litigant,\n\nwho probably  has no  assets in and  few ties to  the forum.\n\nSanta Molina v.  Urban Renewal and Hous.  Corp., 14 Official\n                                               \n\nTranslations  of the Supreme Court of  Puerto Rico 382, 385,\n\n114 P.R.  Dec. 382, 385 (P.R.  1983) (finding constitutional\n\nthe  parallel rule of  the state court).   While recognizing\n\nthe  legitimate interest  served  by the  rule, courts  have\n\nemphasized  that  it  must  be carefully  applied  to  avoid\n\ndepriving a plaintiff, who  may have few financial resources\n\nbut a legitimate claim,  of the opportunity to have  a court\n\ndecide his claim on the merits.   See Aggarwal v. Ponce Sch.\n                                                            \n\nof Medicine, 745 F.2d 723, 728 (1st Cir. 1984) (\"The rule is\n           \n\na scalpel, to be used with  surgical precision as an aid  to\n\nthe even-handed administration of justice, not a bludgeon to\n\nbe employed as an instrument of oppression.\"); Santa Molina,\n                                                           \n\n114  P.R.R. at  385 (inferring  the lawmaker's  intention to\n\nopen the doors of  courthouses to poor litigants).

Thus, we\n\nreview the court's decision only for an abuse of discretion.\n\nAggarwal, 745 F.2d at 726-27.\n        \n\n  This  appeal  falls comfortably  within Aggarwal  v. Ponce\n                                                            \n\nSchool of Medicine where  we vacated an order of  a district\n                  \n\ncourt that  dismissed an  action for plaintiff's  failure to\n\npost  a $5,000 non-resident bond.  Id. at 729.  In Aggarwal,\n                                                           \n\nas  in this  case,  the district  court  failed to  consider\n\nplaintiff's ability to post bond.  Id. at 727-28.   Rule 304\n                                      \n\ndemands  that a court consider at least three factors before\n\nimposing  a  non-resident   bond:     (1)  the   plaintiff's\n\nprobability of success on the merits, and the background and\n\npurpose  of  the suit;  (2)  the  reasonable extent  of  the\n\nsecurity  to be posted, if any,  viewed from the defendant's\n\nperspective; and  (3) the reasonable extent  of the security\n\nto  be  posted,  if  any,  viewed  from  the  nondomiciliary\n\nplaintiff's perspective.   Id.  Moreover, whenever a bond is\n                              \n\nset in excess of the statutory $250 minimum, the trial court\n\nshould evidence  on the record its  careful consideration of\n\neach of these factors.  See id. at 727 n.1, 728-29.\n                               \n\n  In  this case, it  appears that  the district court failed\n\nto consider  Murphy's economic circumstances, his ability to\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\npost the $75,000 bond, and the potentially preclusive effect\n\nof the bond requirement on his ability to pursue litigation.\n\nCertainly,  no such  findings  were made  in  either of  the\n\njudge's   opinions  that  addressed  the  bond  requirement.\n\nThough the court  below expressly considered several  highly\n\nrelevant  factors,  including  the  large  number  of  named\n\ndefendants,  the complex  nature of  the suit,  and  its low\n\nprobability  for  success on  the  merits,  the court  never\n\naddressed plaintiff's  oft repeated  contention that he  was\n\nincapable  of posting  a $75,000  bond.   Appellees' contend\n\nthat though the trial court did not specifically address the\n\nreasonableness of the bond requirement  from the plaintiff's\n\nperspective, it did consider some of the factors relevant to\n                                  \n\nRule 304.  This  argument, however, is plainly at  odds with\n\nour holding in Aggarwal.  Id. at 727 (absent a trial court's\n                             \n\nconsideration of the plaintiff's ability to post a bond, the\n\ncourt's  findings  \"comprise,  at best,  two-thirds  of  the\n\nequation\").\n\n  Appellees  also  complain  that  Murphy  has  relied  upon\n\nconclusory    and   sometimes    contradictory   allegations\n\nconcerning  his financial  condition,  and that  he has  not\n\nproven  his  inability  to  post  the  bond.    Murphy   has\n      \n\nidentified himself  at various  times as self-employed,  the\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\npresident and  sole shareholder of Benevest,  and an officer\n\nof Scanner International.  Moreover, there is no information\n\nbefore the court concerning the financial resources, if any,\n\nof Benevest.  Indeed,  as previously noted, it is  not clear\n\nwhether  Benevest is a separate  entity.  In  spite of these\n\nshortcomings, plaintiff, however, has done what he must.  He\n\nraised  the  issue  before  the trial  court  and  submitted\n\naffidavits  identifying his  annual salary, stating  that he\n\nhas no substantial assets,  and describing his  unsuccessful\n\nattempts  to secure  a  bond.   The error  lies not  in what\n\nplaintiff has  offered as  evidence, but in  that the  court\n\nfailed  even  to  consider   the  evidence  offered  by  the\n                          \n\nplaintiff.   Nevertheless, the  district court will  need to\n\nresolve  these  issues  on  remand  before  it  can  set  an\n\nappropriate bond requirement, if one is imposed at all. \n\n  We vacate  the district court's  order not simply  because\n\nthe court below failed to follow a formalistic three-pronged\n\nevaluation, but  rather because  the trial  court's approach\n\ncomes  dangerously  close   to  making  judicial  access   a\n\nprivilege for only  the most financially secure.   \"While it\n\nis neither  unjust nor unreasonable  to expect a  suitor `to\n\nput \n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nhis money where his mouth is,'  toll-booths cannot be placed\n\nacross the courthouse doors in a haphazard fashion.\"  Id. at\n                                                         \n\n728 (citation omitted).\n\n  The judgment  of the  district  court is  vacated and  the\n                                                            \n\ncase  is   remanded  to  the  district   court  for  further\n                                                            \n\nconsideration of the criteria  for imposing a bond described\n                                                            \n\nabove.\n      \n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n",

The motion, however,\n                                     \n\nwas  never filed or decided.   Rule 304  states, in relevant\n\npart:\n\n  When the plaintiff is  domiciled outside of Puerto Rico\n  or is a foreign  corporation, a bond shall be  required\n  to secure the costs,  expenses and attorneys' fees that\n  may be awarded.   All proceedings in the action  may be\n  stayed until  bond is posted,  which shall not  be less\n  than $250.00.  The Court may require an additional bond\n  upon a showing that the original bond is not sufficient\n  security,  and may  stay the  proceeding in  the action\n  until such additional bond is given.\n\n  After  the lapse of sixty (60) days from the service of\n  the  order requiring  bond or additional  bond, without\n  bond  having been  posted,  the Court  may dismiss  the\n  action.\n\n  This rule  shall be  liberally interpreted in  favor of\n                                                         \n  the  plaintiff so as not  to preclude his  right to sue\n                                                         \n  through  excessive bond  requirement.   Consistent with\n                                       \n  this,  the Court,  for good  cause shown,  may dispense\n  with this requirement.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nD.P.R.L.R. 304 (emphasis added).  Murphy opposed the motion,\n\narguing  that  the  bond  request was  excessive  and  would\n\npreclude  him from  pursuing this  action given  his limited\n\nfinancial resources.  \n\n  On December 20, 1991, the district court issued a  summary\n\norder  requiring  Murphy to  post a  bond  in the  amount of\n\n$75,000 within  90 days;  failure to  comply with the  order\n\nwould  result in the  action being dismissed.   Murphy filed\n\ntwo motions for reconsideration  in which he complained that\n\nhe had been unable  to obtain the requisite bond  because he\n\nhad neither  sufficient income  nor valuable  property; that\n\nthe  $75,000 security  bond  was excessive;  that the  court\n\nfailed to evaluate his ability to post the bond; and that as\n\na result of the court's  order he was \"economically helpless\n\nto  pursue  a bonafide  [sic]  claim  before this  Honorable\n\nCourt.\"    The  district   court  denied  both  motions  for\n\nreconsideration   and   ultimately  dismissed   the  action,\n\nreasoning:\n\n  We  note,  at the  onset that  plaintiff is  suing over\n  sixteen  defendants, raising  complex claims  under the\n  RICO  statute,  breach  of  contract  and tort  claims.\n  Inasmuch as  plaintiff is asking $300,000  to cover his\n  own costs, expenses, and attorney's fees, it should not\n  be  out of line  to consider  that defendants  would be\n  expected to incur in [sic] similar expenses.  Plaintiff\n  does not deny that he was a party to the Superior court\n  cases  upon which  defendants  will  move  for  summary\n  judgment; rather,  he asks that we  order defendants to\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n  provide  him  with   certified  transcripts  of   those\n  proceedings, as if they were never there.\n\nMurphy timely filed a notice of appeal from the dismissal.\n\nANALYSIS\n        \n\n  The  purpose of Rule  304 is  to ensure  that a prevailing\n\nparty will be  able to  collect a judicial  award of  costs,\n\nexpenses, and attorneys' fees  from a non-resident litigant,\n\nwho probably  has no  assets in and  few ties to  the forum.\n\nSanta Molina v.

While recognizing\n\nthe  legitimate interest  served  by the  rule, courts  have\n\nemphasized  that  it  must  be carefully  applied  to  avoid\n\ndepriving a plaintiff, who  may have few financial resources\n\nbut a legitimate claim,  of the opportunity to have  a court\n\ndecide his claim on the merits.

Ponce Sch.\n                                                            \n\nof Medicine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442863\"><a href=\"/opinion/442863/deep-aggarwal-v-ponce-school-of-medicine/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 728 (1st Cir. 1984) (\"The rule is\n           \n\na scalpel, to be used with  surgical precision as an aid  to\n\nthe even-handed administration of justice, not a bludgeon to\n\nbe employed as an instrument of oppression.\"); Santa Molina,\n                                                           \n\n114  P.R.R. at  385 (inferring  the lawmaker's  intention to\n\nopen the doors of  courthouses to poor litigants).

Ponce\n                                                            \n\nSchool of Medicine where  we vacated an order of  a district\n                  \n\ncourt that  dismissed an  action for plaintiff's  failure to\n\npost  a $5,000 non-resident bond.  Id. at 729.  In Aggarwal,\n                                                           \n\nas  in this  case,  the district  court  failed to  consider\n\nplaintiff's ability to post bond.  Id. at 727-28.   Rule 304\n                                      \n\ndemands  that a court consider at least three factors before\n\nimposing  a  non-resident   bond:     (1)  the   plaintiff's\n\nprobability of success on the merits, and the background and\n\npurpose  of  the suit;  (2)  the  reasonable extent  of  the\n\nsecurity  to be posted, if any,  viewed from the defendant's\n\nperspective; and  (3) the reasonable extent  of the security\n\nto  be  posted,  if  any,  viewed  from  the  nondomiciliary\n\nplaintiff's perspective.   Id.  Moreover, whenever a bond is\n                              \n\nset in excess of the statutory $250 minimum, the trial court\n\nshould evidence  on the record its  careful consideration of\n\neach of these factors.  See id. at 727 n.1, 728-29.\n                               \n\n  In  this case, it  appears that  the district court failed\n\nto consider  Murphy's economic circumstances, his ability to\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\npost the $75,000 bond, and the potentially preclusive effect\n\nof the bond requirement on his ability to pursue litigation.\n\nCertainly,  no such  findings  were made  in  either of  the\n\njudge's   opinions  that  addressed  the  bond  requirement.\n\nThough the court  below expressly considered several  highly\n\nrelevant  factors,  including  the  large  number  of  named\n\ndefendants,  the complex  nature of  the suit,  and  its low\n\nprobability  for  success on  the  merits,  the court  never\n\naddressed plaintiff's  oft repeated  contention that he  was\n\nincapable  of posting  a $75,000  bond.   Appellees' contend\n\nthat though the trial court did not specifically address the\n\nreasonableness of the bond requirement  from the plaintiff's\n\nperspective, it did consider some of the factors relevant to\n                                  \n\nRule 304.  This  argument, however, is plainly at  odds with\n\nour holding in Aggarwal.  Id. at 727 (absent a trial court's\n                             \n\nconsideration of the plaintiff's ability to post a bond, the\n\ncourt's  findings  \"comprise,  at best,  two-thirds  of  the\n\nequation\").\n\n  Appellees  also  complain  that  Murphy  has  relied  upon\n\nconclusory    and   sometimes    contradictory   allegations\n\nconcerning  his financial  condition,  and that  he has  not\n\nproven  his  inability  to  post  the  bond.    Murphy   has\n      \n\nidentified himself  at various  times as self-employed,  the\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\npresident and  sole shareholder of Benevest,  and an officer\n\nof Scanner International.  Moreover, there is no information\n\nbefore the court concerning the financial resources, if any,\n\nof Benevest.  Indeed,  as previously noted, it is  not clear\n\nwhether  Benevest is a separate  entity.  In  spite of these\n\nshortcomings, plaintiff, however, has done what he must.  He\n\nraised  the  issue  before  the trial  court  and  submitted\n\naffidavits  identifying his  annual salary, stating  that he\n\nhas no substantial assets,  and describing his  unsuccessful\n\nattempts  to secure  a  bond.   The error  lies not  in what\n\nplaintiff has  offered as  evidence, but in  that the  court\n\nfailed  even  to  consider   the  evidence  offered  by  the\n                          \n\nplaintiff.   Nevertheless, the  district court will  need to\n\nresolve  these  issues  on  remand  before  it  can  set  an\n\nappropriate bond requirement, if one is imposed at all. \n\n  We vacate  the district court's  order not simply  because\n\nthe court below failed to follow a formalistic three-pronged\n\nevaluation, but  rather because  the trial  court's approach\n\ncomes  dangerously  close   to  making  judicial  access   a\n\nprivilege for only  the most financially secure.   \"While it\n\nis neither  unjust nor unreasonable  to expect a  suitor `to\n\nput \n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nhis money where his mouth is,'  toll-booths cannot be placed\n\nacross the courthouse doors in a haphazard fashion.\"  Id. at\n                                                         \n\n728 (citation omitted).\n\n  The judgment  of the  district  court is  vacated and  the\n                                                            \n\ncase  is   remanded  to  the  district   court  for  further\n                                                            \n\nconsideration of the criteria  for imposing a bond described\n                                                            \n\nabove.\n      \n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n</pre>",
