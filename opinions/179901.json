García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Gregorio Igartúa for the appellants.\n     Claudio Aliff-Ortiz with whom Guillermo Somoza-Colombani,\nAttorney General of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Irene Soroeta\nKodesh, Solicitor General of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,\nEliezer Aldarondo-Ortiz, and Eliezer A. Aldarondo-López were on\nbrief for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, amicus curiae.\n     Mark R. Freeman, Appellate Staff, Civil Division, Department\nof Justice, with whom Tony West, Assistant Attorney General, Rosa\nEmilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United Stated Attorney, and Michael Jay\nSinger, Appellate Staff, Civil Division, Department of Justice,\nwere on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                        November 24, 2010\n\f           LYNCH, Chief Judge.           Plaintiff Gregorio Igartúa and\n\nothers have brought suit claiming they and other U.S. citizen-\n\nresidents of Puerto Rico have a right to vote for a Representative\n\nto the U.S. House of Representatives from Puerto Rico and a right\n\nto have Representatives from Puerto Rico in that body.                Long ago,\n\nresidents of Puerto Rico were granted U.S. citizenship by statute.\n\nSee Pub. L. No. 368, ch. 145, § 5, 39 Stat. 951 (1917).\n\n           Igartúa's putative class action claim is supported in\n\npart by the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which\n\nhas filed a brief amicus curiae and presented oral argument.                   The\n\ndefendants are the United States, as well as the President of the\n\nUnited States, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Clerk of the\n\nUnited States House of Representatives, all in their official\n\ncapacities. Among the remedies Igartúa seeks is an order directing\n\nthese   officials   to   \"take   all    the   necessary   steps   .    .   .    to\n\nimplement[] the apportionment of Representatives [in the] electoral\n\nprocess to Puerto Rico.\"\n\n           The district court dismissed the complaint.            See Igartua\n\nv. United States, No. 08-1174 (D.P.R. June 3, 2009).              On de novo\n\nreview, we affirm the dismissal. The text of the U.S. Constitution\n\ngrants the ability to choose, and so to vote for, members of the\n\nHouse of Representatives to \"the People of the several States.\"\n\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 2.         Since Puerto Rico is not a state, and\n\ncannot be treated as a state under the Constitution for these\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fpurposes, its citizens do not have a constitutional right to vote\n\nfor members of the House of Representatives.               Igartúa's claim that\n\ninternational law requires a contrary result is foreclosed by our\n\ndecision   in     the   last     case    Igartúa     brought   before   us.   See\n\nIgartúa-de la Rosa v. United States (Igartúa III), 417 F.3d 145\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).          The case was properly dismissed.\n\n            The    panel    is    unanimous     in    agreeing   that   the   U.S.\n\nConstitution does not give Puerto Rico residents the right to vote\n\nfor members of the House of Representatives because Puerto Rico is\n\nnot a state.\n\n            Chief Judge Lynch and Judge Lipez conclude that this\n\npanel is bound by Igartúa III's holding that the Constitution does\n\nnot permit granting such a right to the plaintiffs by means other\n\nthan those specified for achieving statehood or by amendment.\n\nChief Judge Lynch independently concludes that this holding in\n\nIgartúa III is correct.          Judge Lipez considers the panel bound by\n\nthis holding in Igartúa III, but he does not express a view of his\n\nown on its merit.         Chief Judge Lynch and Judge Lipez agree that\n\nIgartúa III requires dismissal of plaintiffs' claims based on\n\ntreaties and international law. Judge Lipez joins the holding that\n\ndismissal of the case is affirmed. He joins this introduction, the\n\nintroduction to Section II, Sections II.A, II.B, and II.C.1, and\n\nSection    III    of    Chief    Judge    Lynch's     opinion.     He   expresses\n\nadditional views in his concurring opinion.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f           Judge Torruella dissents and is of the view that the\n\nconstitutional text neither denies citizens of Puerto Rico the\n\nright to vote for members of the House of Representatives nor\n\nimposes a limitation on the federal government's authority to\n\nextend   the     franchise   to   territorial   residents        under   other\n\nconstitutional powers.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           This is plaintiff Igartúa's fourth case before this court\n\nraising questions about the ability of the U.S. citizen-residents\n\nof Puerto Rico to vote for those high federal officials described\n\nin the Constitution.      In three earlier decisions, including an en\n\nbanc decision, this court rejected Igartúa's analogous claims that\n\nPuerto   Rican    U.S.   citizen-residents   have    a   right   to   vote   in\n\nelections for President and Vice President of the United States.\n\nSee Igartúa III, 417 F.3d 145; Igartúa de la Rosa v. United States\n\n(Igartúa II), 229 F.3d 80 (1st Cir. 2000); Igartúa de la Rosa v.\n\nUnited States, 32 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 1994).           These cases inform our\n\nanalysis of this admittedly different, but related question.\n\n           Igartúa's arguments are unavailing.           First, the text of\n\nthe Constitution, in several provisions, plainly limits the right\n\nto choose members of the House of Representatives to citizens of a\n\nstate.   Second, the constitutional text is entirely unambiguous as\n\nto what constitutes statehood; the Constitution explicitly recites\n\nthe thirteen original states as being the states and articulates a\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fclear mechanism for the admission of other states, as distinct from\n\nterritories.     Puerto Rico does not meet these criteria.    Third,\n\nthese provisions of the constitutional text are deliberate and go\n\nto the heart of the Constitution.      This deliberate constitutional\n\nframework may not be upset.\n\n          This Section addresses these points, which require the\n\ndismissal of plaintiffs' complaint.     The subsequent Sections turn\n\nto the additional arguments raised by Igartúa and the government of\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n          The analysis of Igartúa's constitutional claims begins\n\nwith the pertinent text of the U.S. Constitution as to the U.S.\n\nHouse of Representatives.     This language is different from that\n\ngoverning the ability to vote for President, which was at issue in\n\nIgartúa III.\n\n          The text of the Constitution refers directly to the\n\nelection of members of the House of Representatives in Article I,\n\nArticle II, and the Fourteenth Amendment.        Article I reads, in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n          The House of Representatives shall be composed\n          of Members chosen every second Year by the\n          People of the several States, and the Electors\n          in each State shall have the Qualifications\n          requisite for Electors of the most numerous\n          Branch of the State Legislature.\n\n          No person shall be a Representative who shall\n          not have attained to the Age of twenty five\n          Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the\n          United States, and who shall not, when\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in\n            which he shall be chosen.\n\n            Representatives . . . shall be apportioned\n            among the several States which may be included\n            within   this   Union,  according   to   their\n            respective Numbers . . . .      The Number of\n            Representatives shall not exceed one for every\n            thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at\n            Least one Representative . . . .\n\n            When vacancies happen in the Representation\n            from any State, the Executive Authority\n            thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill\n            such Vacancies.\n\n            . . . .\n\n            The Times, Places and Manner of holding\n            Elections for Senators and Representatives,\n            shall be prescribed in each State by the\n            Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at\n            any   time  by   Law  make  or   alter  such\n            Regulations, except as to the Places of\n            Chusing Senators.\n\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 1-4 (emphasis added); id. § 4, cl. 1\n\n(emphasis   added).   Article   I   itself   uses   the   term   \"State\"   or\n\n\"States\" eight times when defining and outlining the House of\n\nRepresentatives.\n\n            In addition to Article I, Article II, when referring to\n\nthe election of the President, reads:\n\n            Each State shall appoint . . . a Number of\n            Electors, equal to the whole Number of\n            Senators and Representatives to which the\n            State may be entitled in the Congress.\n\nId. art. II, § 1, cl. 2 (emphasis added).       This reinforces the link\n\nbetween statehood and the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f              Further, the Fourteenth Amendment, when describing the\n\napportionment of Representatives, states:\n\n              Representatives shall be apportioned among the\n              several States according to their respective\n              numbers, counting the whole number of persons\n              in each State . . . .\n\nId. amend. XIV, § 2 (emphasis added).               The amendment process has\n\nbeen used to reinforce, not to alter, the original text that\n\nRepresentatives come from the states.\n\n              The text of Article I is clear that only the people of a\n\nstate may choose the members of the House of Representatives from\n\nthat state.         Id. art. I, § 2, cl. 1 (\"The House of Representatives\n\nshall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People\n\nof the several States.\").            We reject Igartúa's argument that this\n\ntext refers only to \"People\" and that we may ignore the express\n\nlimitation on representation to \"People of the several States.\"\n\nId. (emphasis added).1            Our conclusion is reinforced by Article I,\n\nSection 2, Clauses 2 through 4, as well as by Article I, Section 4,\n\nArticle II, Clause 2, and Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nwhich       again    refer   to     states   in   describing   the   number   of\n\nRepresentatives, their apportionment, and the setting of elections.\n\n              The text of the Constitution defines the term \"State\" and\n\naffords no flexibility as to its meaning.             The term is unambiguous\n\n\n\n        1\n          The term \"People\" clarifies that Representatives are not\nto be chosen by state legislatures. Seth Lipsky, The Citizen's\nConstitution 5 n.12 (2009).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fand refers to the thirteen original states, which are specifically\n\nnamed in Article I, Section 2, id. art. I, § 2, cl. 3, and those\n\nwhich have since joined the Union through the process set by the\n\nConstitution, id. art. IV, § 3, cl. 1; see also Pollard v. Hagan,\n\n44 U.S. 212, 216 (1845) (noting that states which join the union\n\nthrough     the   constitutionally       ordained    process    \"must     be\n\nadmitted . . . on an equal footing with the rest\").            Puerto Rico\n\nfits in none of these categories.\n\n            Because Puerto Rico is not a state, it may not have a\n\nmember of the House of Representatives.           Id. art. I, § 2, cl. 1.\n\nAnd because Puerto Rico is not a state, the legislature of Puerto\n\nRico may not set any time, place, or manner for holding elections\n\nfor Representatives.     Id. § 4, cl. 1.     Nor is Puerto Rico included\n\nin the apportionment for the House.2         Id. § 2 cl. 3; id. amend.\n\nXIV, § 2.   The text of the Constitution does not permit plaintiffs\n\nto vote for a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.                It\n\ncannot, then, be unconstitutional to conclude the residents of\n\nPuerto Rico have no right to vote for Representatives.\n\n            Statehood   is   central   to   the   very   existence   of   the\n\nConstitution, which expressly distinguishes between states and\n\n\n\n     2\n          While the population of Puerto Rico is included in census\ndata collected by the Secretary of Commerce, so is census data from\nU.S. territories and possessions other than states.      13 U.S.C.\n§ 191.    Only the data on the population of the states is\ntransmitted to Congress by the President for apportionment\npurposes. 2 U.S.C. § 2a(a); 13 U.S.C. § 141(b).\n\n                                   -8-\n\fterritories, see U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 1.                     The limitation\n\non representation in the House to the people of the states was\n\nquite deliberate and part of the Great Compromise.                           The Great\n\nCompromise, which enabled the fledgling states to move beyond loose\n\naffiliation and achieve nationhood, depended precisely on this firm\n\ndefinition    of   a     \"State.\"         The     Framers     appeared        at     the\n\nConstitutional     Convention     as   representatives           of    the    thirteen\n\nindividual    states.3      See     Max    Farrand,     The      Framing       of    the\n\nConstitution of the United States 10-11 (1913).                  Disputes between\n\ndelegates from more and less populous states regarding how to\n\nstructure congressional representation brought the convention to a\n\nstandstill.    Id. at 97.\n\n          The Great Compromise broke the deadlock, by providing\n\nthat \"the People of the several States\" would be represented in\n\nproportion    to   their    several       populations       in        the    House   of\n\nRepresentatives, whereas the Senate would have two senators per\n\nstate, regardless of the state's population.                See id. at 91-106;\n\nsee also Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 10-13 (1964) (detailing\n\nthe debate over representation).               That compromise was explicitly\n\npredicated    on   the   definition       of    statehood     contained        in    the\n\n\n     3\n          Indeed, the thirteen former colonies' identity as\n\"states\" predated the Constitution.      See, e.g., Wesberry v.\nSanders, 376 U.S. 1, 9 (1964) (\"Though the Articles [of\nConfederation] established a central government for the United\nStates, as the former colonies were even then called, the States\nretained most of their sovereignty, like independent nations bound\ntogether only by treaties.\").\n\n                                       -9-\n\fConstitution.       See Wesberry, 376 U.S. at 13 (\"The debates at the\n\n[Constitutional] Convention make at least one fact abundantly\n\nclear:    that    when    the    delegates      agreed   that    the   House   should\n\nrepresent 'people' they intended that in allocating Congressmen the\n\nnumber assigned to each State should be determined solely by the\n\nnumber of the State's inhabitants.\") (emphasis added); see also\n\nUtah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 477 (2002) (noting the \"important\n\nconstitutional determination[] that comparative state political\n\npower in the House would reflect comparative population\") (emphasis\n\nadded);    Henry     Paul        Monaghan,      We    the   People[s],        Original\n\nUnderstanding, and Constitutional Amendment, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 121,\n\n143   (1996)     (\"[I]n    the    new   constitutional       order,    the     [Great]\n\nCompromise       ensured    that      the    states      would   be    part    of   an\n\n'indestructible      Union,       composed      of    indestructible     States.'\")\n\n(quoting Texas v. White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700, 725 (1868)).\n\n            The Framers also included a procedure to amend the\n\nConstitution       should       the     basic     compromise--centered         around\n\nstatehood–-require alteration. U.S. Const. art. V. There has been\n\nno amendment that would permit the residents of Puerto Rico to vote\n\nfor Representatives to the U.S. House of Representatives.                      Indeed,\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment adhered to the requirement of statehood\n\nfor purposes of representation in the House of Representatives that\n\nis articulated in the original constitutional text.                      Id. amend.\n\nXIV, § 2.        By contrast, the District of Columbia has, through\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fconstitutional amendment, been given the ability to have electors\n\nfor purposes of electing the President and Vice President of the\n\nUnited States.    Id. amend. XXIII, § 1.\n\n            We concluded in Igartúa III and conclude again here that\n\nPuerto   Rico    \"is   not   a   'state'    within   the   meaning   of   the\n\nConstitution.\"    417 F.3d at 147.4        As we held there, voting rights\n\nto choose electors are \"confined\" to citizens of the states because\n\nthat \"is what the Constitution itself provides.\"           Id. at 148.    On\n\nthe same basis, affirmance of this action is necessary.              Voting\n\nrights for the House of Representatives are limited to the citizens\n\nof the states absent constitutional amendment to the contrary.\n\n            Several other arguments made by the government of Puerto\n\nRico5 and Igartúa that the plaintiffs nonetheless have a right to\n\nvote for a Representative to the U.S. House of Representatives are\n\nrejected.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            The government of the Commonwealth argues that because\n\nthere is caselaw treating Puerto Rico as the functional equivalent\n\n\n\n     4\n          The special relationship between the Commonwealth of\nPuerto Rico and the United States is described in detail in Igartúa\nIII and will not be repeated here.      See Igartúa-de la Rosa v.\nUnited States, 417 F.3d 145, 147 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).\n     5\n          Although we do not normally deal with arguments raised\nfor the first time by amici, this court has discretion to do so.\nSee, e.g., Aroostook Band of Micmacs v. Ryan, 484 F.3d 41, 51 n.11\n(1st Cir. 2007). The importance of this case warrants the exercise\nof that discretion.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fof a state for purposes of applying certain constitutional clauses,\n\nit follows that Puerto Rico must also be treated as the functional\n\nequivalent of a state for purposes of voting to elect a member of\n\nthe House of Representatives. As the government puts the argument,\n\nthe Commonwealth \"does not need to be a State of the Union to be\n\nentitled to representation in the House of Representatives.\"\n\n             The government of Puerto Rico further urges that the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723\n\n(2008), decided after Igartúa III, supports its argument and\n\nsupersedes our reasoning in rejecting that very claim in Igartúa\n\nIII.       The government argues that the relationship between the\n\nUnited States and Puerto Rico has so strengthened in ways which are\n\nconstitutionally significant under Boumediene that Puerto Rico is\n\n\"de facto\" a state for Article I House of Representative purposes.\n\nThe government also argues that it is inherent in the grant of\n\nAmerican citizenship to the residents of Puerto Rico that they be\n\nafforded the \"right to elect voting representatives to the House of\n\nRepresentatives.\"\n\n             Finally, Igartúa asserts that international agreements\n\nand treaties as well as customary international law require that\n\nhis claim be granted.      Such arguments were rejected before, and\n\nthey do not succeed here.6\n\n\n       6\n          We also reject the argument made by Igartúa, but not made\nby the government, that this case must be heard by a three-judge\ndistrict court under 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a). That statute provides\n\n                                 -12-\n\fA.          The Government of Puerto Rico's Argument That the\n            Commonwealth Must Be Treated as the Functional Equivalent\n            of a State for Purposes of Article I Fails\n\n            The government of Puerto Rico recognizes that the claim\n\nthat Puerto Rico is the functional equivalent of a state was\n\navailable at the time of Igartúa III, even if not made then as\n\nexplicitly as it is made in this case.      Nonetheless, we examine the\n\nargument and reject it.\n\n            The   government,   relying   primarily     on   First   Circuit\n\ncaselaw, correctly notes that for some constitutional purposes\n\nPuerto Rico has been treated as the functional equivalent of a\n\nstate.     For    example,   Eleventh   Amendment    restrictions    on   the\n\njurisdiction of the federal courts have been extended to Puerto\n\nRico.    See, e.g., Nieves-Márquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 127\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).     Puerto Rico's government has also been subjected\n\nto the constraints of the dormant Commerce Clause.           Trailer Marine\n\nTransp. Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez, 977 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            Further, a number of provisions of the Bill of Rights\n\nthat have been applied as against the states by incorporation\n\nthrough the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment have\n\nalso been extended against Puerto Rico.             See, e.g., Mangual v.\n\nRotger-Sabat, 317 F.3d 45, 53 n.2 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"[R]esidents of\n\n\n\nthat a \"district court of three judges shall be convened\nwhen . . . an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of\nthe apportionment of congressional districts.\" Id. That is not\nthe issue in this case.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fPuerto Rico are protected by the First Amendment.\"); Tenoco Oil\n\nCo., Inc. v. Dep't of Consumer Affairs, 876 F.2d 1013, 1017 n.9\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (noting that Puerto Rico residents are given\n\nprocedural due process rights under either or both the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments); United States v. Lopez Audino, 831 F.2d\n\n1164, 1168 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Puerto Rico is to be treated as a\n\nstate for purposes of [a criminal defendant's protection under] the\n\ndouble jeopardy clause.\").7\n\n           However, no case, from this court or the Supreme Court,\n\nhas ever held that Puerto Rico is to be treated as the functional\n\nequivalent of a state for purposes of the House of Representative\n\nclauses of Article I of the Constitution; nor does the government\n\nsay such a case exists.\n\n           The \"functional equivalent\" argument is refuted by a\n\nplain reading of the text of the Constitution.     The constitutional\n\ntext allocates voting for members of the House to people of a\n\n\"State.\"   See U.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 1-4.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          Although the government of Puerto Rico relies on these\nand similar cases, the cases guarantee the rights of individuals\nagainst the government of Puerto Rico and are not concerned with an\nexpansion or recharacterization of the status of Puerto Rico\nitself. Similarly, application of the Eleventh Amendment to Puerto\nRico is not a grant of authority to Puerto Rico, but rather is a\nrestriction on the federal courts' jurisdiction in certain cases.\nSee, e.g., Fresenius Medical Care Cardiovascular Res., Inc. v. P.R.\n& the Carribean Cardiovascual Center Corp., 322 F.3d 56, 63 (1st\nCir. 2003).\n\n                               -14-\n\f           As a result, there is no room for a court to deviate from\n\nthe words of the Constitution or to adopt a functional equivalency\n\ntest.   No constitutional text vests the power to amend or the power\n\nto create a new state in the federal courts.      No such power is\n\ngranted to the courts by Article III, which creates and limits the\n\njurisdiction of the federal courts.       This alone precludes our\n\naccepting the government's functional equivalent argument.\n\nB.         The Government of Puerto Rico's Argument Regarding the\n           Effect of Boumediene v. Bush Is Incorrect\n\n           The government of Puerto Rico also argues that the\n\nSupreme Court's 2008 decision in Boumediene, 553 U.S. 723, supports\n\nthe adoption of a \"de facto\" test for statehood and requires\n\nrethinking of the conclusion reached in Igartúa III.     Boumediene\n\ndoes no such thing.\n\n           Boumediene addressed whether aliens designated as enemy\n\ncombatants and detained at the United States Naval Station at\n\nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, \"have the constitutional privilege of habeas\n\ncorpus, a privilege not to be withdrawn except in conformance with\n\nthe Suspension Clause.\"    Id. at 732.   The case has nothing to do\n\nwith whether U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico may vote for\n\nmembers of the House of Representatives or whether Puerto Rico\n\nshould be treated as a state for House of Representatives purposes.\n\n           The government argues that Boumediene has nonetheless\n\nestablished a \"de facto\" test governing whether U.S. citizens\n\nresiding in Puerto Rico may vote for and have a Representative in\n\n                                -15-\n\fthe House of Representatives.              It is not entirely clear from the\n\ngovernment's argument whether the content of this proposed \"de\n\nfacto\"    test    is    different     in    substance    from     the   \"functional\n\nequivalent\" test we rejected above.\n\n            The    government       of     Puerto   Rico's    claim     is    that   in\n\nBoumediene the Supreme Court \"in effect revisited its position\n\nregarding the rights of those residing in territories of the United\n\nStates.\"    The government cites out of context to several of the\n\nSupreme Court's statements in that case.                 The government relies\n\nheavily    on     the      Court's       observation     that      \"questions        of\n\nextraterritoriality        turn     on     objective    factors    and       practical\n\nconcerns, not formalism.\"           Id. at 764.     The government argues that\n\nthe Court described the Insular Cases as applying to territories\n\n\"with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions that Congress\n\nintended    to    govern    only     temporarily,\"      id.   at   759       (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted), and notes the Court's recognition that\n\n\"[i]t may well be that over time the ties between the United States\n\nand any of its unincorporated territories strengthen in ways that\n\nare of constitutional significance,\" id. at 758.\n\n            On the basis of these quotations, concerned with an\n\nentirely different question, the government argues that the Supreme\n\nCourt has adopted a functional, de facto approach to all questions\n\nof the effect of territorial status.                It further argues that the\n\ndegree of integration between Puerto Rico and the United States has\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\fled to a relationship that is comparable to the relationship\n\nbetween the national government and one of the fifty \"de jure\"\n\nstates of the Union.\n\n           The government's argument both misapplies Boumediene and\n\noverreaches. As the United States points out, the Boumediene court\n\nwas concerned only with the Suspension Clause, U.S. Const. art. I,\n\n§ 9, cl. 2, and not with Article I, Section 2, or any other\n\nconstitutional text.       No question is raised in this case about the\n\nextraterritorial availability of habeas corpus under the Suspension\n\nClause.8    To   the   extent      a    de    facto    analysis      may     govern   the\n\navailability of the writ of habeas corpus for aliens designated as\n\nenemy combatants and held at Guantanamo, there was no claim in\n\nBoumediene that Guantanamo was a state of the United States.\n\nFurther,   unlike   Article        I,   Section       2,    the   Suspension     Clause\n\ncontains   no    mention     of    the       \"States,\"      nor    is   it    otherwise\n\ngeographically limited.       Id.\n\n           Boumediene did not hold that courts may disregard the\n\nexplicit   language     in        the    text    of        the    Constitution        that\n\nrepresentation in the House is given to \"the People of the several\n\nStates.\"   Nor did the Supreme Court hold that all provisions of the\n\nConstitution, regardless of constitutional text, may be applied\n\nwithout regard to whether a state is involved.                      Cf. District of\n\n\n\n     8\n          The residents of Puerto Rico have the federal writ of\nhabeas corpus available to them by statute. 48 U.S.C. § 872.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fColumbia v. Carter, 409 U.S. 418, 420 (1973) (\"Whether the District\n\nof Columbia constitutes a 'State or Territory' within the meaning\n\nof any particular . . . constitutional provision depends upon the\n\ncharacter and aim of the specific provision involved.\").\n\n           Because the government of Puerto Rico's argument is based\n\non a misreading of Boumediene, we need not address its claim about\n\nthe precise status of Puerto Rico.            What is clear is that the\n\nCommonwealth     \"is   not    a   'state'   within   the   meaning   of   the\n\nConstitution.\"     Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 147.           Even if the ties\n\nbetween the United States and Puerto Rico were strengthened in ways\n\nthat might have some constitutional significance as to habeas\n\ncorpus, that would have no bearing on the Article I question before\n\nus.\n\n           Moreover, an earlier line of Supreme Court cases, not\n\noverruled by Boumediene, plainly rejected the \"de facto\" approach,\n\nwhich the government urges, to determining what qualifies as a\n\nstate.   As early as 1805, Chief Justice Marshall rejected a claim\n\nby residents of the District of Columbia that the Court should\n\ntreat the District as a state because it met some political\n\ntheorists' definition of a \"state,\" that is, a discrete political\n\nsociety.   Hepburn & Dundas v. Ellzey, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 445, 445-\n\n46, 452-53 (1805).           Chief Justice Marshall explicitly quoted\n\nArticle I's language concerning the election of Representatives \"by\n\nthe people of the several states\" as evidence \"that the word state\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fis used in the constitution as designating a member of the union,\n\nand excludes from the term the signification attached to it by\n\nwriters on the law of nations.\"      Id. at 452-53.\n\n          The Supreme Court applied similar reasoning in two later\n\nnineteenth century cases to reject arguments by residents of the\n\nFlorida and Mississippi territories that these territories should\n\nbe treated as states.   Am. Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 26 U.S.\n\n(1 Pet.) 511, 542 (1828) (noting that residents of Florida \"do not\n\n. . . participate in political power\" and \"do not share in the\n\ngovernment, until Florida shall become a state\"); Corp. of New\n\nOrleans v. Winter, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 91, 94 (1816) (\"It has been\n\nattempted to distinguish a Territory from the district of Columbia;\n\nbut the court is of opinion, that this distinction cannot be\n\nmaintained . . . [N]either of them is a state, in the sense in\n\nwhich that term is used in the constitution.\").\n\n          More   recently,   the    Supreme   Court   has   affirmed   the\n\nrejection of variations on both the \"functional equivalent\" and the\n\n\"de facto\" arguments made here.      In Adams v. Clinton, 90 F. Supp.\n\n2d 35 (D.D.C. 2000) (per curiam), aff'd without opinion, 531 U.S.\n\n941 (2000), the Supreme Court affirmed the rejection by a three-\n\njudge court of the claim that denial of the right to vote in\n\ncongressional elections to District of Columbia residents was\n\nunconstitutional.   Relying in part on the constitutional language\n\nand history discussed above, the three-judge court concluded that\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f\"the overlapping and interconnected use of the term 'state' in the\n\nrelevant provisions of Article I, the historical evidence of\n\ncontemporary understandings, and the opinions of our judicial\n\nforebears all reinforce how deeply Congressional representation is\n\ntied to the structure of statehood.\"               Adams, 90 F. Supp. 2d at 56.\n\n              Courts of appeals have reached the conclusion that U.S.\n\nterritories are not states for similar purposes.                        The Virgin\n\nIslands      are   not   a   state      for   purposes   of   federal   elections,\n\nBallentine v. United States, 486 F.3d 806, 811 (3d Cir. 2007), nor\n\nis Guam, Attorney Gen. of the Territory of Guam v. United States,\n\n738 F.2d 1017, 1019 (9th Cir. 1984).\n\n              The government of Puerto Rico's final argument is that\n\nsince the people of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens by statute, that\n\ngrant of citizenship from Congress carries with it a fundamental\n\nright to elect Representatives to the House of Representatives.\n\nCongress granted citizenship and other privileges to the residents\n\nof Puerto Rico as an exercise of its constitutional authority under\n\nthe Territory Clause.             U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2.           Under\n\nother provisions of the Constitution, however, the right to vote is\n\ngiven   to    residents      of   the    States,   not   to   citizens.     Hence,\n\n\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\fcitizenship alone does not trigger the right               to vote.9     The\n\ngovernment's argument therefore fails.\n\nC.          Igartúa's Arguments About Treaty and International Law\n            Obligations Are Without Merit\n\n            Igartúa urges that the United States must meet certain\n\nobligations under international agreements, treaties, and customary\n\ninternational law, including the obligation to provide him a vote\n\nfor Representatives to the United States House of Representatives.10\n\nIn particular, Igartúa relies on portions of (1) the International\n\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, opened for signature Dec.\n\n16, 1966, 999 U.N.T.S. 171; (2) the Universal Declaration of Human\n\nRights, G.A. Res. 217 A(III), U.N. Doc. A/810 (1948); (3) the\n\nInter-American Democratic Charter of the Organization of American\n\nStates, 28th Spec. Sess., OAS Doc. OEA/Ser.P/AG/RES.1 (XXVIII-E/01)\n\n\n     9\n          The caselaw cited by the government of Puerto Rico\nillustrates the point. The Supreme Court has often emphasized the\nimportance of the right to vote. See, e.g., Burson v. Freeman, 504\nU.S. 191, 198 (1992); Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383\nU.S. 663, 667 (1966); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 560 (1964)\n(quoting Wesberry, 376 U.S. at 17-18); see also Dep't of Commerce\nv. Montana, 503 U.S. 442 (1992). However, in each of these cases\nthe Court has addressed the voting rights of citizens \"of the\nseveral States.\"\n     In other words, the Court's recognition of the right to vote\nhas been consistently cabined by the geographical limits set out in\nthe Constitution. See, e.g., Wesberry, 376 U.S. at 17; Heald v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 259 U.S. 114, 124 (1922) (upholding a tax\nlevied on residents of the District of Columbia, reasoning that\n\"[t]here is no constitutional provision which so limits the power\nof Congress that taxes can be imposed only upon those who have\npolitical representation\").\n     10\n            The   government   of   Puerto   Rico   does   not   join   this\nargument.\n\n                                    -21-\n\f(OAS General Assembly) (Sept. 11, 2001); and (4) the American\n\nDeclaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, O.A.S. Res. XXX\n\n(1948), O.A.S. Off. Rec. OEA/Ser. LV/I.4 Rev. (1965).\n\n            The    Court   in   Igartúa       III     rejected       similar   claims\n\nregarding three of these four agreements. The court also held that\n\ncustomary international law does not require \"a particular form of\n\nrepresentative government.\"         Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 151.                If an\n\ninternational norm of democratic governance exists, we held, \"it is\n\nat   a   level    of   generality   so    high      as   to     be   unsuitable    for\n\nimportation into domestic law.\"           Id.       The same reasoning applies\n\nhere. Neither international agreements nor customary international\n\nlaw mandates that residents of Puerto Rico who are U.S. citizens be\n\nable to vote for members of the House of Representatives.\n\n            The dissent goes beyond the claims made by the parties\n\nwith respect to one international agreement.                    The dissent argues,\n\nas   though      the   issues   were     open    in      this    court,   that     the\n\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) both\n\nis a \"self-executing\" treaty and that it creates individual rights\n\nenforceable in federal courts.           But these issues are not open.\n\n            1.    Igartúa III Binds the Court\n\n            We are bound by the en banc court's decision in Igartúa\n\nIII, which expressly opined on these issues. That decision reached\n\nthree relevant conclusions: (1) treaty obligations do not override\n\nthe Constitution; (2) the international agreements at issue in\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fIgartúa III, including the ICCPR, do not constitute domestic law\n\nbecause they are not self-executing and Congress has not enacted\n\nimplementing legislation; and (3) there were other problems with\n\nthe treaty claims in Igartúa III, including personal standing and\n\nredressability.       Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 148-150.   Without more,\n\nIgartúa III thus forecloses us from considering the treaty-based\n\nclaims in this case.11\n\n             2.    The Dissent Relies on Waived and Forfeited Arguments\n\n             The dissent's argument that the ICCPR creates rights\n\nunder domestic law extends beyond the claims before this court.\n\nArguments that are intentionally relinquished or abandoned are\n\nwaived, and arguments that are not raised in a timely manner are\n\nforfeited.        See United States v. Morgan, 384 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).    An argument raised in a perfunctory or not serious manner\n\nis waived.    See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).    Review is unavailable for waived arguments \"unless the\n\ncourt engages in the rare exercise of its power to excuse waiver.\"\n\nMorgan, 384 F.3d at 7.        Plain error review may be available for\n\n\n\n\n     11\n           The American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man\nwas not addressed by the majority in Igartúa III.         Like the\nUniversal Declaration on Human Rights and the Inter-American\nDemocratic Charter, this agreement is merely an aspirational\nstatement.    Garza v. Lappin, 253 F.3d 918, 923 (7th Cir. 2001)\n(noting that the declaration \"is merely an aspirational document\nthat, in itself, creates no directly enforceable rights\"); see also\nFlores v. S. Peru Copper Corp., 414 F.3d 233, 263 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\n                                    -23-\n\fforfeited arguments, but it is seldom available for claims neither\n\nraised below nor on appeal.           Id. at 8.\n\n            Igartúa and the government of Puerto Rico do not claim\n\nthat the ICCPR is a self-executing treaty or that the ICCPR\n\noverrides   Article    I   of   the    Constitution   by   operation   of   the\n\nSupremacy Clause.      The government of Puerto Rico made an express\n\nchoice not to join these arguments, thereby both waiving and\n\nforfeiting them.      Igartúa contends that each agreement he invokes\n\n\"requires the signatory country to provide a judicial remedy for\n\nclaims of citizens invoking rights under it.\"               But he does not\n\nsupport this contention with argument as to how the agreements bind\n\nfederal courts.     Igartúa cites the ICCPR merely \"as supportive,\"\n\nnoting that it has \"been used by many courts to interpret existing\n\nU.S. law or to determine legal rights when the plaintiff has an\n\nindependent cause of action\"           (emphasis added).     This amounts to\n\nforfeiture if not waiver.\n\n            The dissent fails to recognize this waiver or forfeiture,\n\nand fails to meet the conditions for considering the arguments.\n\n            3.   Stare Decisis Binds this Court to follow Igartúa III\n\n            This court is not free to disregard the holdings of\n\nIgartúa III under the rule of stare decisis.           As this circuit has\n\naffirmed before, stare decisis \"incorporates two principles: (1) a\n\ncourt is bound by its own prior legal decisions unless there are\n\nsubstantial reasons to abandon a decision; and (2) a legal decision\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\frendered by a court will be followed by all courts inferior to it\n\nin the legal system.\" United States v. Rodriguez-Pacheco, 475 F.3d\n\n434, 441 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting 3 J. Moore et al., Moore's\n\nManual: Federal Practice and Procedure § 30.10[1] (2006)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n           This circuit has recognized two exceptions to the rule of\n\nstare decisis.     First, the rule does not apply when \"[a]n existing\n\npanel   decision     [is]    undermined    by   controlling     authority,\n\nsubsequently announced, such as an opinion of the Supreme Court, an\n\nen banc opinion of the circuit court, or a statutory overruling.\"\n\nId.   (quoting Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st\n\nCir. 1995)) (alteration in original).       Second, in \"relatively rare\n\ninstances . . . authority that postdates the original decision,\n\nalthough not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound\n\nreason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh\n\ndevelopments, would change its collective mind.\"               Id. at 442\n\n(quoting Williams, 45 F.3d at 592).\n\n           We have interpreted the latter exception narrowly.           It\n\napplies when \"recent Supreme Court precedent calls into legitimate\n\nquestion a prior opinion of an inferior court.\"               Id. (quoting\n\nEulitt v. Maine, 386 F.3d 344, 350 (1st Cir. 2004)) (alteration in\n\noriginal). Such instances, we have noted, \"fairly may be described\n\nas hen's-teeth rare.\"       Id.   (quoting United States v. Guzmán, 419\n\nF.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2005)).\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f          a.   Controlling Authority Reinforces Igartúa III\n\n          Not only has there been no Supreme Court decision that\n\ncalls Igartúa III into question,12 the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nMedellín v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491 (2008), reinforces our en banc\n\ndecision and analysis.   Our conclusions here are a required result\n\nof the judicial function under Medellín, and are not judicial\n\nactivism in any sense.\n\n          In our analysis of the ICCPR in Igartúa III, we began\n\nwith the text of the treaty.       We stated that nothing in the\n\ntreaties at issue in Igartúa III, including the ICCPR, \"says\n\n\n     12\n          The dissent argues that Igartúa does not possess the\nconstitutional right he asserts, but argues that Congress could\nextend the franchise to the citizens of Puerto Rico without making\nPuerto Rico a state or ratifying a constitutional amendment. As\nexplained above, this argument is foreclosed by our en banc\ndecision in Igartúa III. The dissent makes three arguments, each\nof which lacks merit.\n     First, the dissent cites caselaw that existed when we decided\nIgartúa III. Second, the dissent suggests that Congress is not\nlimited by Article I when it implements a treaty obligation, citing\nMissouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416 (1920). Neither plaintiff nor\nthe Commonwealth make this argument. But even if the argument were\nnot waived, Holland does not sweep so broadly. That decision held\nthat Congress may legislate beyond its Commerce Clause power to\nimplement a treaty. Holland, 452 U.S. at 432-33. It did not hold\nthat Congress may disregard Article I's structural provisions\ngoverning the election of Representatives, not to mention similar\nprovisions in Article II and the Fourteenth Amendment.\n     Third, the dissent contends that the Framers did not intend to\nimbue the distinction between a \"state\" and a \"territory\" in the\nConstitution with any meaning.      This claim, like much of the\ndissent's argument, ignores that this court is an inferior court\nsubject to Supreme Court precedent.      There is no dispute that\nSupreme Court doctrine has long distinguished between the\nConstitution's treatment of states and territories      See, e.g.,\nBoumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 757-58 (2008) (discussing the\nInsular Cases).\n\n                                -26-\n\fanything about just who should be entitled to vote for whom, or\n\nthat an entity with the negotiated relationship that the United\n\nStates has with Puerto Rico is nevertheless required to adopt some\n\ndifferent arrangement as to governance or suffrage.\"       Igartúa III,\n\n417 F.3d at 149.\n\n           Next, we noted that the Supreme Court concluded that the\n\nICCPR is not self-executing in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S.\n\n692 (2004).      Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 150.   In Sosa, the Supreme\n\nCourt   relied    upon   congressional   statements   accompanying   the\n\nSenate's   ratification of the ICCPR.     Sosa, 542 U.S. at 728, 735.\n\nWe then looked to those congressional statements.        We wrote that\n\nthe ICCPR \"was submitted and ratified on the express condition that\n\nit would be 'not self-executing.'\"       Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 150\n\n(quoting 138 Cong. Rec. S4781, S4784 (daily ed. Apr. 2, 1992)).\n\nThe Senate voiced this condition \"as requested by the executive.\"\n\nId. at 185 (Howard, J., dissenting).\n\n           \"Whatever limited room there may be for courts to second-\n\nguess the joint position of the President and the Senate that a\n\ntreaty is not self-executing,\" we held, \"it is certainly not\n\npresent in a case in which the Supreme Court has expressed its own\n\nunderstanding of a specific treaty in the terms\" used in Sosa.       Id.\n\nat 150.    Our reasoning thus rested on not only the text of the\n\nICCPR but the positions of all three branches of government.\n\n           Medellín explicitly ratified Igartúa III's analysis of\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fself-executing treaties.      In Medellín, the Supreme Court held that\n\nwhether a treaty is self-executing depends upon the language of\n\nimplementing statutes and the language of the treaty ratified by\n\nthe Senate.   Medellín, 552 U.S. at 505.            It summarized this holding\n\nby quoting Igartúa III's conclusion that treaties \"are not domestic\n\nlaw unless Congress has either enacted implementing statutes or the\n\ntreaty itself conveys an intention that it be 'self-executing' and\n\nis ratified on these terms.\"        Id. (quoting Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at\n\n150) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Medellín adds further weight to this court's deference to\n\nthe political branches in construing treaties like the ICCPR.\n\nMedellín   emphasized    that       the    courts       may   not    supplant     the\n\nconstitutional    role   of   the    political       branches       in   making   and\n\napproving treaties.       Id. at 515.              It gave deference to the\n\nexecutive branch's interpretation of whether the treaty at issue in\n\nthat case was domestically enforceable.                 Id. at 513.       The Court\n\ntempered   that   deference     to    the     executive       in    light    of   the\n\nlegislative role in transforming an international obligation from\n\n\"a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law.\"                         Id. at 525\n\n(citing Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 150).\n\n           This court's holding in Igartúa III that the ICCPR is not\n\na   self-executing   treaty   thus        stands   on    strengthened       ground.13\n\n\n      13\n          Contrary to Igartúa and the dissent's assertions, the\nSupreme Court's engagement with international law in Abbott v.\nAbbott, 130 S. Ct. 1983 (2010), only reinforces our conclusion. In\n\n                                      -28-\n\fMedellín supports our reliance in Igartúa III on both the text of\n\nthe ICCPR and the joint position of the legislative and executive\n\nbranches.    The Supreme Court has not contradicted its statement in\n\nSosa that the ICCPR is not self-executing.14      It follows that our\n\nconclusion that the ICCPR is not a self-executing treaty still\n\nrests on the positions of all three branches of government.\n\n            b.    The Circuit Courts Unanimously Reinforce Igartúa III\n\n            The Supreme Court's dictum in Sosa that the ICCPR is not\n\nself-executing has been made holding in every circuit that has\n\nconsidered the issue.15       Only the D.C. Circuit and the Federal\n\nCircuit have not reached the question of whether the ICCPR is self-\n\nexecuting.       It is the unanimous view of every other circuit that\n\nthe ICCPR is not self-executing.\n\n\nthat case, the Court addressed a provision of the Hague Convention\non the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Oct. 24,\n1980, T.I.A.S. No. 11670, which Congress had explicitly implemented\nthrough the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 11601 et seq. Id. at 1987.\n     14\n          Medellín     did not purport to undercut Sosa. As a circuit\ncourt, we are not       empowered to determine that a Supreme Court\ndecision has been      overruled.   Citizens United v. Fed. Election\nComm'n, 130 S. Ct.     876, 893 (2010).\n     15\n          Carefully considered Supreme Court dicta, though not\nbinding, \"must be accorded great weight and should be treated as\nauthoritative.\" Crowe v. Bolduc, 365 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 2004)\n(quoting United States v. Santana, 6 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1993))\n(internal quotation mark omitted). Although the Supreme Court may\nignore its own dicta, we are a lower court bound by the Supreme\nCourt.   Neither the brevity of the discussion in Sosa nor the\nconcessions of the petitioner in that case suggests that the\nSupreme Court did not carefully consider its conclusions about the\nICCPR.\n\n                                   -29-\n\f            Six circuits reached this conclusion before the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Sosa and our decision in Igartúa III.                      See\n\nBannerman v. Snyder, 325 F.3d 722, 724 (6th Cir. 2003); United\n\nStates v. Duarte-Acero, 296 F.3d 1277, 1283 (11th Cir. 2002); Hain\n\nv. Gibson, 287 F.3d 1224, 1243 (10th Cir. 2002); United States ex\n\nrel. Perez v. Warden, FMC Rochester, 286 F.3d 1059, 1063 (8th Cir.\n\n2002); Beazley v. Johnson, 242 F.3d 248, 267-68 (5th Cir. 2001);\n\nsee also Dutton v. Warden, FCI Estill, 37 F. App'x 51, 53 (4th Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n            The   four   remaining      circuits    have        relied   on   some\n\ncombination of Sosa, Medellín, and Igartúa III.                    See Serra v.\n\nLappin, 600 F.3d 1191, 1196-97 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Medellín and\n\nSosa); Clancy v. Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Dep't\n\nof the Treasury, 559 F.3d 595, 603-04 (7th Cir. 2009) (citing\n\nSosa); Ballentine v. United States, 486 F.3d 806, 814-15 (3d Cir.\n\n2007) (citing Sosa and Igartúa III); Guaylupo-Moya v. Gonzales, 423\n\nF.3d 121, 133, 137 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Igartúa III).\n\n            In the absence of countervailing authority, there is no\n\nground to revisit Igartúa III's holding that the ICCPR is not self-\n\nexecuting. Circuit precedent does not call Igartúa III into doubt;\n\nit reinforces the en banc court's conclusions.\n\n            Our   conclusions   in     Igartúa   III     remain    binding    law,\n\nincluding our conclusion that the ICCPR is not self-executing.\n\nThis     case   does   not   present    an    occasion     to     revisit     those\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\fconclusions.   Given that the ICCPR is not self-executing, we are\n\nobligated to go no further.        This is not merely a matter of\n\njudicial discipline.      It is a matter of constitutional dimension\n\nunder Article III.       Federal courts have \"neither the power 'to\n\nrender advisory opinions nor to decide questions that cannot affect\n\nthe rights of litigants in the case before them.'\"       Preiser v.\n\nNewkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401 (1975) (quoting North Carolina v. Rice,\n\n404 U.S. 244, 246 (1971)).\n\n                                  III.\n\n           We affirm the dismissal of the action.      No costs are\n\nawarded.   So ordered.\n\n\n\n                   -Concurring Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\f               LIPEZ,      Circuit   Judge,        concurring    in     the    judgment).\n\nDespite our court's 2005 en banc decision rejecting the right of\n\nPuerto Rico's four million residents to vote in presidential\n\nelections,       the     issue    of     federal      voting     rights        for    these\n\nlongstanding United States citizens remains a compelling legal\n\nproblem.       The unequal distribution of the fundamental privilege of\n\nvoting among different categories of citizens is deeply troubling\n\nand,     not    surprisingly,          the    legal     arguments        in     favor    of\n\nenfranchising Puerto Rico residents have continued to evolve.\n\nAlthough       the      en    banc      decision       forecloses        this        panel's\n\nreconsideration of issues the full court resolved, that decision\n\nshould not be the final word on the subject.                          Judge Torruella's\n\ndissent highlights important issues that deserve consideration in\n\na new en banc proceeding.               As I shall explain, if each of those\n\nissues were decided in plaintiffs' favor, United States citizens\n\nresiding in Puerto Rico would have a viable claim to equal voting\n\nrights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political\n\nRights (\"ICCPR\").\n\n               Thus, while I agree with Chief Judge Lynch that our panel\n\nmust adhere to the precedent set five years ago by the en banc\n\ncourt    on    the   constitutional          and    treaty    interpretation         issues\n\naddressed       in   the     majority    opinion,      I     cannot    agree    that    the\n\nplaintiffs' claims should be dismissed without review by the full\n\ncourt.     Given the magnitude of the issues and Judge Torruella's\n\n\n                                             -32-\n\fforceful     analysis,         this    is    one    of    those    rare    occasions   when\n\nreconsideration of an en banc ruling is warranted.\n\n                             I. The Constitutional Argument\n\n                 In    the    2005    en     banc,       the    majority    rejected    the\n\nplaintiffs'           contention      that    the    Constitution         required   giving\n\ncitizens who reside in Puerto Rico the right to vote for President\n\nand Vice President of the United States.                       See Igartúa-de la Rosa v.\n\nUnited States (Igartúa III), 417 F.3d 145, 147 (1st Cir. 2005) (en\n\nbanc).       In this appeal, the plaintiffs attempt to distinguish\n\npresidential and vice-presidential voting from the election of\n\nmembers of the House of Representatives, emphasizing that the\n\nlatter      is    governed       by   a     different      constitutional      provision.\n\nCompare U.S. Const. art. II, § 1, cl. 2 with id. art. I, § 2, cl.\n\n1.16\n\n\n       16\n          Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 describes the process for\nelecting the President and Vice President, in part, as follows:\n\n                 Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as\n                 the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number\n                 of Electors, equal to the whole Number of\n                 Senators and Representatives to which the\n                 State may be entitled in the Congress . . . .\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment specifies that the electors shall meet \"in\ntheir respective states\" to cast ballots for President and Vice\nPresident. U.S. Const. amend. XII.\n\n       Article I, Section 2, Clause 1 provides:\n\n                 The House of Representatives shall be composed\n                 of Members chosen every second Year by the\n                 People of the several States, and the Electors\n                 in each State shall have the Qualifications\n\n                                              -33-\n\f             That distinction makes no difference, however, because\n\nthe    two   constitutional     provisions      similarly    enfranchise          only\n\nindividuals residing in \"States.\"               Since Puerto Rico is not a\n\n\"State,\" the 2005 en banc decision precludes us from holding that\n\nthe Constitution requires extending the right to vote for full-\n\nstatus members of the House of Representatives to the residents of\n\nPuerto Rico.       Moreover, if the issue were before us as a matter of\n\nfirst impression, I would join my colleagues in concluding that the\n\ndenial of that right to Puerto Rico citizens does not violate\n\nArticle I, Section 2 of the Constitution.\n\n             To say that the Constitution does not require extension\n\nof    federal   voting     rights   to   Puerto   Rico    residents      does     not,\n\nhowever, exclude the possibility that the Constitution may permit\n\ntheir enfranchisement under another source of law.                      The 2005 en\n\nbanc    majority    also    concluded,     at   least    implicitly,      that     the\n\nConstitution     prohibits     enfranchising      Puerto    Rico    residents       in\n\npresidential       elections    because     the   privilege        of    voting     is\n\nrestricted to electors who are chosen by citizens of \"State[s].\"\n\nSee Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 148 (noting that \"the franchise for\n\nchoosing electors is confined to 'states'\") (emphasis added).\n\nBecause Article I, Section 2 defines those eligible to vote for\n\nmembers of the House in that similarly narrow way, Igartúa III's\n\n\n\n             requisite for Electors of the most numerous\n             Branch of the State Legislature.\n\n                                         -34-\n\fholding is also binding in this appeal on the question whether the\n\nConstitution \"confine[s]\" voting for members of Congress to State\n\nresidents.\n\n            I have doubts, however, about the correctness of the\n\njudgment that the Constitution allows only citizens who reside in\n\nstates to vote.       To be sure, the unstated premise of my concurrence\n\nin the 2005 en banc was that the Constitution restricted the right\n\nto vote to residents of states.         My view was – and remains – that\n\nthe plaintiffs' claims under the ICCPR are not justiciable if the\n\nConstitution itself prohibits equal voting rights for Puerto Rico\n\nresidents.    A constitutional amendment or Puerto Rico's admission\n\nas a state would then be the only ways to remove the barrier.                See\n\nIgartúa III, 417 F.3d at 153 (Lipez, J., concurring).              I concluded\n\nthat, in such circumstances, even if the plaintiffs' arguments had\n\nmerit as a matter of treaty interpretation, court intervention\n\nwould be inappropriate because the possibility of a remedy would be\n\noverly speculative.       Id. at 158.\n\n            Indeed, and perhaps more to the point, it would be\n\nmeaningless for a court to consider whether the United States is in\n\nviolation     of   a    treaty    provision    that    conflicts      with   the\n\nConstitution.      The Constitution trumps the treaty and, if a treaty\n\npurports to do something the Constitution forbids, a court would\n\nhave   no    choice    but   to   conclude    that    the   treaty,    not   the\n\nConstitution, must give way.        Saying or doing more than that would\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fbe inappropriate; it is not the court's role to tell the federal\n\ngovernment how to meet international obligations in the face of a\n\nconstitutional prohibition.    See id. at 155 (quoting Chicago & S.\n\nAir Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948) (\"[I]f\n\nthe President may completely disregard the judgment of the court,\n\nit would be only because it is one the courts were not authorized\n\nto render.\")).\n\n          Everything changes, however, if the Constitution permits\n\nequal voting rights to be conferred on the residents of Puerto Rico\n\nunder another source of law, such as legislation or a self-\n\nexecuting international treaty.           If the Constitution does not\n\nprohibit extending the right to vote to citizens who reside outside\n\n\"the several States,\" an enforceable treaty could provide the\n\ngoverning domestic law on that issue.        See Medellín v. Texas, 552\n\nU.S. 491, 518 (2008) (noting that a self-executing treaty is\n\n\"'equivalent to an act of the legislature'\" (citation omitted)).\n\nThe Constitution itself makes treaties \"the supreme Law of the\n\nLand\" where they do not conflict with the Constitution's own terms.\n\nSee U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.       This is not a view of the ICCPR\n\nthat I contemplated in 2005, but it is one that I now consider\n\nworthy of serious examination.\n\n          As   Judge   Torruella    points    out,   the   view   that   the\n\nConstitution does not necessarily forbid extensions of the rights\n\nit delineates has been articulated in scholarly writing, and it\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\funderlies the effort to legislate voting rights for residents of\n\nthe District of Columbia.             See Opinion of Torruella, J.; see also\n\nJosé R. Coleman Tió, Comment, Six Puerto Rican Congressmen Go to\n\nWashington, 116 Yale L.J. 1389, 1394 (2007). Judge Torruella aptly\n\ninvokes    as    well   precedent       applying     the       same    notion   of   the\n\nConstitution's reach – i.e., that it neither requires nor prohibits\n\nconferring rights on citizens outside the States – in the context\n\nof diversity jurisdiction.            That precedent, including the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in National Mutual Insurance Co. v. Tidewater\n\nTransfer Co., 337 U.S. 582 (1949), confirmed Congress's power to\n\nextend diversity jurisdiction to the District of Columbia even\n\nthough the provisions of Article III creating such jurisdiction\n\nrefer only to States.         By analogy, such cases support the argument\n\nthat references in Article I to the voting rights of the people of\n\n\"the States\" are not necessarily negative references to the voting\n\nrights of citizens residing in other United States jurisdictions.\n\nCf.   Adams     v.   Clinton,    90    F.    Supp.   2d    35,    95    (D.D.C.   2000)\n\n(Oberdorfer, J., dissenting in part) (\"[T]he use of the term\n\n'State' in the diversity jurisdiction clause of the Constitution\n\ncannot    mean   'and   not     of    the    District     of   Columbia.'\"      (citing\n\nTidewater)).\n\n              Moreover, the redressability concern that underlay my\n\nconcurrence in Igartúa III stemmed in large part from the courts'\n\ninability to order Congress to take the only actions that I thought\n\n\n                                            -37-\n\fcould deliver the remedy the plaintiffs sought – \"to either admit\n\nPuerto Rico as a state or to propose a Constitutional amendment\n\nallocating electors to Puerto Rico.\"      See 417 F.3d at 154.     If\n\nPuerto Rico residents' right to vote originates from a source of\n\nUnited States law other than the Constitution, however, it is\n\npossible that declaratory relief could properly involve individual\n\ngovernment officials rather than Congress.    For example, precedent\n\nindicates that the Secretary of Commerce is empowered to take the\n\nsteps necessary to conform the apportionment process to the law.\n\nSee Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802 (1992) (plurality\n\nopinion)   (noting   that   \"injunctive   relief   against   executive\n\nofficials like the Secretary of Commerce is within the courts'\n\npower\") (citing Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579\n\n(1952)); Adams, 90 F. Supp. 2d at 41 (noting that the Secretary of\n\nCommerce is tasked with reporting the population of each state to\n\nthe President for congressional apportionment).\n\n           I do not mean to suggest that I already have concluded\n\nthat the Constitution in fact permits giving the plaintiffs the\n\nright to vote like any other United States citizen for members of\n\nthe House of Representatives.       Rather, my point is that the\n\nquestion is important and complex, and it deserves re-examination\n\nby the full court with the benefit of the best advocacy we can\n\nenlist on both sides of the issue.        As I describe in the next\n\n\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\fsection, however, it is only one of the issues warranting such\n\nreconsideration.\n\n                  II. The Status and Impact of the ICCPR\n\n             If we were to conclude that the Constitution permits\n\nCongress to give Puerto Rico residents voting rights with respect\n\nto members of the House of Representatives equivalent to those\n\nafforded the residents of the States, our inquiry would then need\n\nto   focus   on   plaintiffs'   claim   that   the   ICCPR   provides   such\n\nenfranchisement. The status of the ICCPR also was addressed in the\n\n2005 en banc decision, which held that the treaty was not self-\n\nexecuting and did \"not adopt any legal obligations binding as a\n\nmatter of domestic law.\"        Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 150.           That\n\ndetermination may not be considered anew by the panel in this case.\n\n             However, the en banc majority's conclusion that the ICCPR\n\nis non-self-executing is also ripe for reconsideration in a new en\n\nbanc proceeding.      The 2005 majority accepted without analysis two\n\ncomments by the Supreme Court in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S.\n\n692, 728 (2004), in dicta,17 that the ICCPR is not a self-executing\n\n\n      17\n          Although I recognize that Supreme Court dicta may be more\npersuasive than such statements made by other courts, the Supreme\nCourt itself has recognized the limitations of its dicta: \"[W]e are\nnot bound to follow our dicta in a prior case in which the point\nnow at issue was not fully debated.\"      Cent. Va. Cmty. Coll. v.\nKatz, 546 U.S. 356, 363 (2006) (quoting Cohens v. Virgina, 6 Wheat.\n264, 399 (1821) (\"It is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general\nexpressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with\nthe case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond\nthe case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the\njudgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is presented for\n\n                                   -39-\n\ftreaty.     See Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 150.       The Supreme Court, in\n\nturn, had accepted without scrutiny the Senate's declaration that\n\n\"the    substantive   provisions   of     the   document   were   not   self-\n\nexecuting.\"    See Sosa, 542 U.S. at 728.18       In adopting its view of\n\nthe treaty, the 2005 majority rejected Judge Howard's thoughtful\n\nanalysis in dissent explaining why the Senate lacks the authority\n\nto declare the status of a treaty.          See Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at\n\n189-91 (Howard, J., dissenting).19         In his dissent in this case,\n\n\ndecision.\")).\n       18\n          In that first reference to the ICCPR, the Court in Sosa\nstated that the Senate has at times \"expressly declined to give the\nfederal courts the task of interpreting and applying international\nhuman rights law, as when its ratification of the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights declared that the\nsubstantive provisions of the document were not self-executing.\"\n542 U.S. at 128. Later in the decision the Court stated: \"[T]he\nUnited States ratified the Covenant on the express understanding\nthat it was not self-executing and so did not itself create\nobligations enforceable in the federal courts.\" Id. at 735. As\nJudge Torruella notes, however, both of the Supreme Court's\nobservations were dicta because \"the question of the ICCPR's self-\nexecution was never presented to the Court\" and the petitioner had\nconceded that it was not self-executing.\n       19\n          Judge Howard explained that the Senate's non-self-\nexecution declaration concerning the domestic effect of the ICCPR\nwas \"in reality[] an attempt to legislate concerning the internal\nimplementation of a treaty,\" which the Senate lacked the power to\ndo. Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 190-91 (dissenting opinion). Judge\nHoward noted that the declaration was therefore \"merely an\nexpression of the Senate's view of domestic policy . . . [with] no\ndomestic effect.\" Id. at 191. The Supreme Court in Sosa did not\nconclude otherwise. See id. at 191 n.63 (\"Because the question in\nSosa was not the binding effect of the Senate's non-self-execution\ndeclaration in determining whether the ICCPR establishes a private\ncause of action, the parties did not present the Court with (and it\ndid not address) the separation of powers arguments questioning the\nSenate's authority to issue such declarations.\").\n\n                                   -40-\n\fJudge Torruella builds on Judge Howard's earlier decision and\n\nargues plausibly that the surrounding circumstances demonstrate\n\nthat the ICCPR should be construed as a self-executing treaty.\n\n            In 2005, my view of the case made it unnecessary for me\n\nto evaluate Judge Howard's conclusion that the courts, rather than\n\nthe Senate, have the responsibility to determine whether a treaty\n\nis self-executing.      My view was that, whatever the status of the\n\ntreaty, it was not the role of a court to declare that the\n\nplaintiffs had voting rights that were inconsistent with the\n\nlimitations built into the Constitution.              Having now accepted the\n\npossibility that the Constitution does not bar federal voting\n\nrights for Puerto Rico residents, I also must confront the ICCPR's\n\nstatus.\n\n            The passage of time has only strengthened Judge Howard's\n\nanalysis.      The    Supreme    Court       has    recently   confirmed     that\n\ndetermining whether a treaty is self-executing \"is, of course, a\n\nmatter for [the courts] to decide.\"                Medellín, 552 U.S. at 518.\n\nHence, the Senate cannot on its own \"declare\" the status of a\n\ntreaty.     As Judge Howard observed, a Senate \"'declaration is not\n\npart of a treaty in the sense of modifying the legal obligations\n\ncreated by it.        A declaration is merely an expression of an\n\ninterpretation or of a policy or position.'\" Igartúa III, 417 F.3d\n\nat   190   (quoting   Stefan    A.   Riesenfeld      &   Frederick   M.   Abbott,\n\nForeword: Symposium on Parliamentary Participation in the Making\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fand Operation of Treaties, 67 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 293, 296 (1991)).\n\nIn other words, \"the Senate's view is relevant,\" id. at 191, but\n\n\"'[t]he Senate's declaration is not law,'\" id. at 190 (quoting\n\nRiesenfeld & Abbott, 67 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. at 296-97).\n\n            In describing the courts' independent \"obligation to\n\ninterpret treaty provisions to determine whether they are self-\n\nexecuting,\" the Court in Medellín emphasized the central importance\n\nof the treaty language.     See 552 U.S. at 514, 518-19 (\"It is well\n\nsettled that the [i]nterpretation of [a treaty] . . . must, of\n\ncourse, begin with the language of the Treaty itself.\") (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); id. at 514 (referring to the \"time-\n\nhonored textual approach\" for interpreting treaties); see also\n\nAbbott v. Abbott, 130 S. Ct. 1983, 1990 (2010) (\"The interpretation\n\nof a treaty . . . begins with its text.\" (quoting Medellín, 552\n\nU.S. at 506)).     With respect to the specific treaty before it in\n\nMedellín,    the   Court   also     looked   to   the   \"'postratification\n\nunderstanding'     of   signatory    nations,\"    id.   at   516,   \"general\n\nprinciples of interpretation,\" id. at 517, and the consequences of\n\nreading the treaty in a particular way, id. at 517-518.             See also\n\nSanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U.S. 331, 344 & n.3, 347 (2006)\n\n(considering other signatories' understanding of the treaty at\n\nissue).     Neither the 2005 majority nor the Supreme Court in Sosa\n\nperformed such an examination of the ICCPR, which necessarily makes\n\nthem unreliable precedent on its status.\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\f            Again, I do not want to suggest that I have reached an\n\nultimate view on whether the ICCPR is self-executing.                   I am saying\n\nonly that, if the plaintiffs succeed before the en banc court on\n\nthe threshold issue of the Constitution's reach, they would be\n\nentitled to reconsideration by the en banc court of the ICCPR's\n\nstatus.    That is so because the 2005 majority improperly rejected\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim that the treaty is self-executing without\n\nconducting an independent analysis of its language and, if the\n\nlanguage    is   unclear,    the     \"'postratification        understanding'    of\n\nsignatory nations\" and other surrounding circumstances.\n\n            Even   if   we    were    to   find   that   the    treaty    is   self-\n\nexecuting, however, difficult questions would remain.                    Among them\n\nare whether the treaty's provisions in fact oblige the United\n\nStates to provide all of its citizens the right to elect voting\n\nmembers of the House of Representatives and whether the treaty\n\nprovides for a private right of action as a vehicle for pursuing\n\nthat   right.      Also      of    consequence    is     the   unique     political\n\nrelationship between Puerto Rico and the United States government.\n\nWhether a generally stated commitment to provide the right to vote\n\nto all citizens should supersede the specific political negotiation\n\nthat has led to Puerto Rico's status is not an easily answered\n\nquestion.    The fact that the questions are difficult, however, is\n\nnot a reason to avoid them.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -43-\n\f            III. Summarizing the Prerequisites for a Claim\n\n            Unquestionably, the plaintiffs face a series of hurdles\n\nin demonstrating their entitlement to declaratory relief.                   Their\n\nclaims are much more potent, however, than Chief Judge Lynch's\n\nopinion acknowledges.           If the Constitution permits extension of\n\nvoting rights to Puerto Rico residents by means of a treaty,20 and\n\nif   the   ICCPR   is   a   self-executing       treaty    whose   terms   support\n\nassertion of a private cause of action, the plaintiffs' claims\n\ncould not be so easily dismissed.\n\n            At its core, this case is about whether a substantial\n\ngroup of United States citizens should be given a right that our\n\ncountry and the international community agree is a fundamental\n\nelement of a free society.            Article 25 of the ICCPR states, in\n\nrelevant part, that \"[e]very citizen shall have the right and the\n\nopportunity . . . [t]o vote and to be elected at genuine periodic\n\nelections    which      shall   be   by    universal      and   equal   suffrage.\"\n\n(Emphasis added.) At a minimum, given the importance of the issues\n\nand the evolving debate, fairness dictates that the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims receive considerably more deliberation than our panel is\n\nauthorized to provide.           The entire court should be engaged in\n\n\n      20\n          Whether Congress's plenary authority to regulate Puerto\nRico under the Territory Clause of the Constitution also could\nprovide a basis for such action is a question beyond the scope of\nthis case. See U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (\"The Congress\nshall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and\nRegulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to\nthe United States . . . .\").\n\n                                          -44-\n\fconsidering and resolving these issues, with the best advocacy\n\navailable   in   support   of   all   parties.   Indeed,   as    a   case\n\n\"involv[ing] a question of exceptional importance,\" this action\n\nfits squarely within the guidelines for en banc review.         See Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 35(a) (2).\n\n            Thus, while I agree that the district court's judgment\n\nmust be affirmed by the panel, I urge the court to reconsider the\n\nconstitutional and treaty issues in a new en banc proceeding.\n\n\n\n   -Opinion Concurring in Part and Dissenting in Part Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                  -45-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in part; Dissenting\n\nin part).    Although in a different format than presented on prior\n\noccasions, we once more have before us issues that arise by reason\n\nof the political inequality that exists within the body politic of\n\nthe United States, as regards the four million citizens of this\n\nNation who reside in Puerto Rico.\n\n            This is a fundamental constitutional question that will\n\nnot go away notwithstanding this Court's repeated efforts to\n\nsuppress these issues.21    We can now add to that dismal list the\n\nendeavors of the lead opinion.      This is a most unfortunate and\n\ndenigrating predicament for citizens who for more than one hundred\n\nyears have been branded with a stigma of inferiority, and all that\n\nfollows therefrom.\n\n            At the root of this problem is the unacceptable role of\n\nthe courts.    Their complicity in the perpetuation of this outcome\n\nis unconscionable.     As in the case of racial segregation, see\n\nPlessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 557 (1896) (overruled by Brown v.

United States, 417\nF.3d 145, 148 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Igartúa III\"). By this maneuver,\nthe panel was prevented from reconsidering its original decision.\nThis action, that is, convoking an en banc court to prevent a panel\nfrom reaching an outcome contrary to that which non-panel members\nfavored, is unprecedented in the history of this court and is at\nleast one of the reasons why I do not feel bound by this oppressive\naction. Others reasons will follow.\n\n                                -46-\n\fof   Educ.,    347    U.S.   482   (1954)),   it   is   the   courts   that   are\n\nresponsible for the creation of this inequality.22             Furthermore, it\n\nis the courts that have clothed this noxious condition in a mantle\n\nof legal respectability.\n\n              But perhaps even more egregious is the fact that it is\n\nthis judiciary that has mechanically parroted the outdated and\n\nretrograde underpinnings on which this invented inferiority is\n\nperpetuated.

Was\n              it   to    be   the   relationship    of   the\n              Reconstruction period, an attempt at political\n              equality for dissimilar races, or was it to be\n              the Southern 'counterrevolutionary' point of\n              view   which   denied   the   basic   American\n              constitutional rights to people of color? The\n              actions of the federal government during the\n              imperial period and the relegation of the\n              Negro to a status of second-class citizenship\n              indicated that the Southern point of view\n              would prevail. The racism which caused the\n              relegation of the Negro to a status of\n              inferiority was to be applied to the overseas\n              possessions of the United States.

It is this lack of any political power\n\nby these disenfranchised U.S. citizens, and the cat and mouse games\n\nthat have been played with them by the United States government,\n\nincluding its courts, that have resulted in their interminable\n\nunequal condition.\n\n             When this status of second-class citizenship is added to\n\nthe also judicially-established rule that grants Congress plenary\n\npowers over the territories and their inhabitants, i.e., that\n\nrecognizes in Congress practically unfettered authority over the\n\nterritories and their inhabitants,26 one has to ask what effective\n\npolitical process is the lead opinion suggesting be turned to by\n\nAppellants to resolve the constitutional issues raised by this\n\ncase?     In fact, the referral by the lead opinion to the exercise of\n\npolitical power by these disenfranchised citizens, as the solution\n\nto their political inequality is nothing more than the promotion of\n\nthe continued colonial status that has existed since Puerto Rico\n\nwas acquired by the United States as booty after the Spanish-\n\n\n     26\n          See Territory of Guam v. Olsen, 431 U.S. 195, 205 (1977)\n(Marshall, Stewart, Rehnquist, and Steven, JJ, dissenting) (\"[W]e\ndo not doubt that Congress has the authority in the exercise of its\nplenary powers over Territories of the United States . . . to\nreverse Guam's decision to reorganize its local court system.\")\n(internal   citation   omitted);    Downes,   182   U.S.   at   285\n(characterizing the \"Territorial Clause\" as \"absolute in its terms,\nand suggestive of no limitations upon the power of Congress in\ndealing with them\").\n\n                                  -50-\n\fAmerican War of 1898.27 As such, this suggestion is totally lacking\n\nin consequence or substance, and undeserving of a serious response.\n\n           With the primary vehicle for exerting effective political\n\npressure being barred by the lack of elected voting representatives\n\nin Congress, it is a travesty to tout the political process as a\n\nmeans of vindicating the fundamental inequality of the United\n\nStates citizens who reside in Puerto Rico.            The lead opinion's\n\nruling is the equivalent of having decided, before Brown v. Board\n\nof Education, that African-Americans should forgo their right to\n\njudicial   action   under   the   Constitution   as   the   road   map   to\n\noverruling the inequality promoted by Plessy.\n\n           The present situation is the quintessential condition for\n\nthe exercise by this court of the judicial powers pronounced by the\n\nSupreme Court in Carolene Products in 1938:\n\n           [P]rejudice against . . . insular minorities\n           may be a special condition, which tends\n           seriously to curtail the operation of those\n           political processes ordinarily to be relied\n           upon to protect minorities, and which may call\n           for correspondingly more searching judicial\n           inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n     27\n          It should be noted that under Spanish rule, at the time\nof the invasion of Puerto Rico by the United States, Puerto Ricans\nwere not only full Spanish citizens, but they had full voting\nrights and were represented by twelve delegates and six senators in\nthe Spanish Cortes (Parliament). Today, Puerto Rico has one so-\ncalled \"Resident Commissioner,\" who sits in the House of\nRepresentatives, but does not have a vote. 48 U.S.C. § 891.\n\n                                  -51-\n\fUnited States v.

This is a strategy\n\nthat is not acceptable, for the Constitution is not an instrument\n\nthat can be picked at, or chosen from, at random.        The principled\n\nimplementation of the Constitution requires that it be honored in\n\nits totality, and in an integrated way.        Cf. Colgrove v.

Nonetheless, it is\n\nprecisely   this   principle   which   has   been   disregarded   in   the\n\ncontinued haste to \"put the constitutional claim fully at rest,\"\n\nIgartúa III, 417 F.3d at 146, and forces me to dissent.\n\n\n\n\n     28\n          \"Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental\nmatter in a free and democratic society.

I,\n\n§ 2, cl. 1.    This clause, when considered within the context in\n\nwhich the term \"State\" is used in other structural provisions of\n\nthe Constitution,29 does not by its own force endow citizens\n\nresiding in Puerto Rico with the \"right\" to vote for members of the\n\nHouse of Representatives.   For purposes of this clause, the term\n\n\"State\" means a political entity that has been admitted as such\n\ninto the Union.   Cf. U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 1. Puerto Rico\n\nhas not been admitted as a \"State\" into the Union, and therefore,\n\ncitizens residing there do not qualify as \"People of the Several\n\nStates.\" Accordingly, I agree that under the present circumstances\n\nthe denial of the right to vote for representatives in Congress to\n\nUnited States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico does not violate\n\nthe provisions of Article I.   Cf. Trailer Marine Transp. Corp. v.\n\nRivera Vázquez, 977 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating that\n\nalthough \"[t]oday the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nin many respects resembles that of a state. . .

As recently as last year, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor\n\nindicated that Puerto Rico \"seem[s] to have become a State within\n\na common and accepted meaning of the word.\"           United States v.

In fact, this\n\ndenomination is consistent with how this term has been used in\n\nnumerous and varied constitutional settings by both the Supreme\n\nCourt and by this court.           E.g., Torres v.

These propositions are incorrect, and\n\nstartling in their breadth.         First, while the text of Section 2,\n\nArticle I does not grant to citizens of Puerto Rico the right to\n\nvote for members of the House of Representatives, neither does it\n\nprohibit them that right, nor act as a limitation on the federal\n\ngovernment's authority to extend the franchise to territorial\n\nresidents under other constitutional powers.            Cf. Romeu v. Cohen,\n\n265 F.3d 118, 127-30 (2d Cir. 2001) (Leval, J., writing separately)\n\n(arguing    that   Congressional    authority    over   state   voting   laws\n\nencompasses extending the presidential vote to citizens residing in\n\nthe territories); Nat'l Mut.

The lead opinion's suggestion that Article I's failure to\n\nprovide voting rights to territorial residents prevents the United\n\nStates from achieving political equality through other means lacks\n\nsupport in the text of the Constitution and the Supreme Court's\n\njurisprudence.     It is also based on a flawed historical rationale.\n\n             The lead opinion relies on an unsupportable distinction\n\nbetween the Constitution's use of the word \"State\" and \"territory\"\n\nin    its   structural   provisions    to    conclude   that   Puerto   Rico's\n\npolitical inequality was a deliberate choice of the Framers,\n\nrequiring either its admission as a state or a constitutional\n\namendment to remedy this situation.            But \"[i]ndefinite colonial\n\nrule by the United States is not something that was contemplated by\n\nthe Founding Fathers nor authorized per secula seculorum by the\n\nConstitution.\"     Igartúa-de la Rosa v.

The District of Columbia\nand Puerto Rico are different breeds of political entity.       See\nDistrict of Columbia v.

White,\n74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700, 721 (1868) (\"A state, in the ordinary sense\nof the Constitution, is a political community of free citizens,\noccupying a territory of defined boundaries, and organized under a\ngovernment sanctioned and limited by a written constitution, and\nestablished by the consent of the governed.\")).        Indeed, the\nDistrict is subject to Congress's authority under a distinct\nconstitutional provision.    See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 17\n(\"[The Congress shall have Power] To exercise exclusive Legislation\nin all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten\nMiles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the\nAcceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the\nUnited States.\").\n\n     In any event, I express no opinion on the controversial issue\nof what may be necessary for D.C. residents to obtain the right to\nvote for Members of the House of Representatives.

The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 not\n              only guaranteed the existing territories\n              eventual enfranchisement through admission\n              into the Union, but further stipulated that\n              once a territory had \"sixty thousand free\n              Inhabitants,\" it would \"be admitted by its\n              Delegates into the Congress of the United\n              States on equal footing with the original\n              States.\"     All U.S. territories acquired\n              between 1787 and the Spanish-American War also\n              achieved congressional representation through\n              statehood.\n\n                     The evidence therefore suggests that\n              territorial disenfranchisement was meant to be\n              temporary; territories would be held as\n              states-in-waiting.   Only   the    territorial\n              incorporation doctrine devised by the Insular\n              Cases permitted a sharp deviation from prior\n              practice. But holding colonies like Puerto\n              Rico without the possibility of eventual\n              enfranchisement still runs against the very\n              principles upon which the nation was founded\n              and the Constitution enacted.\n\nId. at 1394.\n\n              Given this background, the use of the term \"State\" in\n\ncertain structural provisions of the Constitution says nothing\n\nabout   the    Framers'   intentions    with   regard   to    the    apparently\n\npermanent and long-standing political inequality of citizens living\n\nin Puerto Rico for more than a century.

This is not a new or remarkable\n\nconcept.     International law has been an integral part of our\n\nconstitutional system since the founding of our Nation. See, e.g.,\n\nSosa   v.   Álvarez-Machain,   542    U.S.   692,   729   (2004)    (\"For   two\n\ncenturies we have affirmed that the domestic law of the United\n\nStates recognizes the law of nations.\"); The Nereide, 13 U.S. 388,\n\n423 (1815) (Marshall, C. J.) (\"[T]he Court is bound by the law of\n\nnations which is a part of the law of the land.\").                    Although\n\ncustomary international law is part of the \"law[] of the United\n\nStates\" within the meaning of Article III and the Supremacy Clause,\n\ne.g., Sosa, 542 U.S. at 726, our primary infusion of international\n\nlaw into domestic law comes from the treaties entered into by the\n\nPresident on behalf of the Nation, which thereafter become part of\n\nour municipal law upon ratification by the Senate.                 U.S. Const.\n\nart. II, §2, cl. 2; see Sosa, 542 U.S. at 729.\n\n            As stated by the Supreme Court in Sosa, \"it would take\n\nsome explaining to say now that federal courts must avert their\n\ngaze entirely from any international norm intended to protect\n\nindividuals.\" Id. at 730. Notwithstanding this firm advice, which\n\nis based on two centuries of jurisprudence, the government invites\n\n                                     -62-\n\fus not only to \"avert our gaze\" from our international obligations,\n\nbut to bury our head in the sand.              The Supremacy Clause requires\n\nmore than that of the Courts of the United States.                 The Paquete\n\nHabana, 175 U.S. at 700.\n\n            Following the dictates of Sosa, our first step is to\n\ninquire into the existence of \"any international norm intended to\n\nprotect individuals\" to which the United States may have agreed.\n\nAlthough Appellants claim the protection of a host of international\n\ncommitments by the United States,33 we need only consider one. This\n\ntreaty is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n                      B.

Rec.\n\nS4781, S4784 (daily ed. Apr. 2, 1992).\n\n          Article 25 of the ICCPR establishes that:\n\n          Every citizen shall     have    the   right   and\n          opportunity . . .\n\n          (a) To take part in the conduct of public\n          affairs, directly or through freely chosen\n          representatives; [and]\n\n          (b) To vote and to be elected at genuine\n          periodic elections which shall be by universal\n          and equal suffrage . . . .\n\nICCPR art. 25 (emphasis supplied).    Plainly, the continued lack of\n\npolitical representation of Appellants is a violation of the United\n\nStates' treaty obligations under Article 25.\n\n          Additionally, pursuant to Article 2(1), the United States\n\n\"undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its\n\nterritory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in\n\nthe present Covenant, without distinction of any kind.\"       Id.   Art.\n\n\n\n     34\n          The United States was a member of the Drafting Committee,\na sub-organ of the Commission on Human Rights of the United\nNations, since this committee began drafting the ICCPR at its first\nsession on June 9-25, 1947. Marc J. Bossuyt, Guide to the \"travaux\npréparatoires\" of the International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights, XIX (1987). It was not until December 16, 1966, after ten\nsessions of the Drafting Committee, and multiple drafts and\namendments, that the General Assembly adopted the ICCPR by 106\nvotes for approval, 2 votes against approval, and 38 votes of\nabstention. The ICCPR entered into force on March 23, 1976, with\n85 states becoming parties to both the ICCPR and the Optional\nProtocol by January 1, 1987. Id. at XX. The United States was not\none of them. It became a signatory party on October 5, 1977, and\na full party on June 8, 1992, after the Senate had ratified the\ntreaty.\n\n                               -64-\n\f2(1) (emphasis supplied).          The United States further agrees \"to\n\ntake the necessary steps, in accordance with its constitutional\n\nprocesses and with the provisions of the present Covenant, to adopt\n\nsuch laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to\n\nthe rights recognized in the present Covenant.\"                    Id. Art. 2(2).\n\nMost importantly, under this treaty the United States specifically\n\ncommits    itself     \"[t]o   ensure   that    any   person    whose    rights    or\n\nfreedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective\n\nremedy.\" Id. Art. 2(3) (a) (emphasis supplied).                In furtherance of\n\nthis provision the United States is obligated \"[t]o ensure that any\n\nperson     claiming    such   a   remedy    shall    have    his   right    thereto\n\ndetermined by competent judicial, administrative or legislative\n\nauthorities, or by any other competent authority provided for by\n\nthe legal system of the State, and to develop the possibilities of\n\njudicial remedy.\"       Id. (emphasis supplied).            The lead opinion, at\n\nthe government's urging, concludes that the exacting language of\n\nthe ICCPR just quoted is meaningless and ineffective, because it is\n\nallegedly \"non-executing.\"         This is an erroneous conclusion which\n\nis   the    result    of   the    court's     failure   to     live    up   to   its\n\nconstitutional duty to independently assess and interpret the\n\nmeaning of a treaty entered into by the United States.                 The Paquete\n\nHabana, 175 U.S. at 700.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -65-\n\f                        C.     The Government's opposition to the domestic\n                               application of the ICCPR\n\n                Appellants' claim for relief under the ICCPR and the\n\nSupremacy Clause is rejected on essentially three general grounds:\n\n(1) the ICCPR is not a \"self-executing\" treaty and thus does not\n\ncreate individual rights that are enforceable in federal court; (2)\n\nthe issues raised by this appeal involve \"political questions,\"\n\nwhich     the    courts      should    abstain      from   deciding;    and    (3)   no\n\n\"effective\" remedy can be granted to Appellants by the courts, and\n\ntherefore       there     is   no     \"Case   and    Controversy\"      and    we   lack\n\njurisdiction.35         The common thread that runs through these three\n\ncontentions is the fact that they are all judicially-created\n\ndoctrines, used to avoid passing upon issues that the courts may,\n\nfor a variety of reasons, wish not to confront.\n\n\n\n\n     35\n           Indeed, the repeated actions by the Government in this,\nand other similar cases, in so opposing Appellants' claims to equal\nvoting rights are in themselves flagrant violations of accords\nentered into by the United States under Article 2, paragraph 3, of\nthe ICCPR, in which it undertook \"[t]o ensure that any person whose\n[ICCPR] rights or freedoms . . . are violated shall have an\neffective remedy,\" and further agreed to ensure that these rights\nbe   \"determined   by   competent  judicial,   administrative,   or\nlegislative authorities, or by any other competent authority\nprovided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the\npossibilities of judicial remedy.\"     ICCPR art. 2(3).    Far from\nthis, the Government has consistently opposed Appellants' attempts\nto obtain an effective remedy. Furthermore, it could be argued with\nconsiderable logic that this court's repeated actions in failing to\nenforce these international commitments, themselves result in\nplacing the United States in violation of the ICCPR assurances that\nan enforceable judicial remedy would be available.\n\n                                          -66-\n\f                             (1)   The doctrine of self-execution of treaties\n                                   and its relevance to the ICCPR36\n\n                                   (a)   The doctrine     of    self-execution    of\n                                         treaties\n\n                   The doctrine of self-execution of treaties, or stated in\n\nthe negative, of non-self-execution, is a judicially-created theory\n\nwhich has, at convenient times, been used to avoid international\n\ncommitments,          particularly       where   human   rights   are   concerned.37\n\nToday, this theory promotes a rule whereby treaties are presumed to\n\nbe non-self-executing, when in fact the text and history of the\n\nSupremacy Clause counsel exactly the opposite.                    Cf. Safety Nat'l\n\nCas. Corp. v. Certain Underwriters, 587 F.3d 714, 737 (5th Cir.\n\n2009)        (en     banc)    (Clement,    J.,     concurring   in   the   judgment)\n\n(explaining that while \"there may be a growing judicial consensus\n\nthat multilateral treaties are presumptively non-self-executing,\"\n\nthat \"consensus\" does not override the Supreme Court's plain-text\n\napproach to questions of self-execution).\n\n\n\n     36\n          The following discussion draws from Judge                        Howard's\ndissenting opinion in Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 185-92.\n        37\n          Courts and commentators have used the term \"self-\nexecution\" or \"non-self-execution\" to include several related but\ndiffering scenarios.     See David N. Cinotti, Note, The New\nIsolationism: Non-Self-Execution Declarations and Treaties as the\nSupreme Law of the Land, 91 Geo. L.J. 1277, 1279-80 (2003)\n(providing three definitions of \"non-self-executing\" treaties,\nnamely treaties that (a) are nonjusticiable, (b) convey no private\nright of action, or (c) require Congress to enact implementing\nlegislation); see also Columbia Marine Servs. Inc. v. Reffet Ltd.,\n861 F.2d 18, 21 (2d Cir. 1988) (defining \"self-executing\" as\nprescribing rules for determining private rights).\n\n                                            -67-\n\f                           (i)   The British Rule\n\n            The idea that treaties entered into by the executive\n\nbranch are not self-executing has its source in Great Britain\n\nwhere, by virtue of their constitutional system, the Crown enters\n\ninto treaties without any intervention by Parliament, before or\n\nafter the treaty is signed.        Thus, Parliament must pass specific\n\nlegislation before a treaty is incorporated into the municipal law\n\nof Great Britain.38\n\n            This, of course, is different with regards to the United\n\nStates, in which the complementary constitutional roles of the\n\nPresident   and   Senate    in   the    negotiation   and   ratification   of\n\ntreaties allow intervention by both branches of government before\n\nthe treaty comes into effect and becomes part of our domestic law.\n\n\n\n\n     38\n          See J.G. Starke, Introduction to International Law 79-80\n(10th ed. 1984) (noting that British law has developed\nindependently of customary international law in that, while the\nCrown possesses the power to enter treaties, Parliament must enact\nenabling legislation because otherwise the Crown would be able to\nunilaterally legislate domestic law without Parliament's consent);\nsee also Ware v. Hylton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199, 275 (1796)\n(explaining that treaties are traditionally non-self-executing in\nGreat Britain in part because \"no man living will say that a bare\nproclamation of the King, upon the ground of treaty\" is adequate\nauthority for enacting domestic law); The Parliament Belge, 4 P.D.\n129 (1879) (holding that a British treaty was non-self executing\nfor the same reasoning previously stated); Carlos Manuel Vázquez,\nTreaty-Based Rights and Remedies of Individuals, 92 Col. L. Rev.\n1082, 1111 (1992) (describing long-standing British law that a\ntreaty does not have domestic effect until Parliament enacts\nimplementing legislation).\n\n                                       -68-\n\f                       (ii) The American Rule\n\n          In the United States, as evidenced by the unambiguous\n\nlanguage of the Supremacy Clause, as well as by the intent of its\n\nframers, treaties are presumed to be self-executing.       See U.S.\n\nConst. art. VI, cl. 2 (\"[A]ll Treaties made, or which shall be\n\nmade, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the\n\nsupreme Law of the Land\").\n\n          The historical record sustaining this proposition is\n\nunquestionable.   During the Constitutional Convention, a proposal\n\nto the effect that treaties be sanctioned by the legislature before\n\nthey had \"the operation of law\" was specifically rejected.       See\n\nJames Madison, Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787\n\n597 (W.W. Norton 1987) (1840).   An alternative proposal, which was\n\nalso rejected, would have established two types of treaties: one\n\nrequiring only action by the President and the Senate, and a second\n\nrequiring additional action by the House of Representatives. 2 The\n\nRecords of the Federal Convention of 1787       538 (Max Farrand ed.\n\nrev. ed. 1966).   In a similar vein, the Committee on Style removed\n\nfrom the final version of the Supremacy Clause language that would\n\nhave given the national government the power to \"enforce treaties.\"\n\nThe Committee struck this language because it was redundant,\n\nconsidering the clear language of the Supremacy Clause.      Id. at\n\n389-90.   The rejection of these proposals illustrates that the\n\nlanguage of the Supremacy Clause was not coincidental, but rather\n\n\n                                 -69-\n\fchosen after due deliberation, and deliberately, to mean what it\n\nsays.\n\n           The expectation that treaties would become operative as\n\ndomestic law upon ratification is also expressed in the Federalist\n\nPapers and the ratification debates within the States.             In The\n\nFederalist No. 22, for example, Alexander Hamilton explained that\n\n\"[t]he treaties of the United States, to have any force at all,\n\nmust be considered as part of the law of the land.            Their true\n\nimport, as far as respects individuals, must, like all other laws,\n\nbe ascertained by judicial determinations.\" The Federalist No. 22,\n\nat   150   (Alexander   Hamilton)     (Clinton   Rossiter   ed.,      1961).\n\nSimilarly, at the North Carolina ratifying convention, one of the\n\nConstitution's   supporters   explained:     \"It   was    necessary    that\n\ntreaties should operate as laws on individuals.          They ought to be\n\nbinding upon us from the moment they are made.           They involve in\n\ntheir nature not only our own rights, but those of foreigners [and\n\nshould be protected by our judiciary].\"          Jordan J. Paust, Self-\n\nExecuting Treaties, 82 Am. J.

Elliot ed., 1941) (1830) (documenting\n\nthe statements of William Davie, a North Carolina delegate to the\n\nConstitutional Convention) (brackets in original)).           Even those\n\nopposing ratification shared this view: \"Brutus,\" in criticizing\n\nArticle III, stated that he could \"readily comprehend what is meant\n\n\n                                    -70-\n\fby deciding a case under a treaty.

Kaminski & Gaspare J. Saladino eds., 1986).\n\n                      (iii)      The American Rule     is   modified:\n                                 Foster v. Neilson\n\n          In Foster v. Neilson, decided by Chief Justice Marshall\n\nin 1829, the Court concluded that the treaty in question was not\n\nself-executing because, by its terms, it did not establish a right\n\nin the individual claimant, but rather placed an obligation on the\n\nlegislative branch to act.    27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 314-15 (1829),\n\noverruled in part by United States v. Perchman, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 51\n\n(1833).   Although the Foster rule has since come into vogue,\n\nparticularly in denying the application of human rights treaties,39\n\nproperly applied it is a rule that makes sense, for a treaty is\n\nwhat amounts to a contract between nations, and as such, what needs\n\nto be done at the outset, as in the case of a contract between\n\n\n\n     39\n          See Louis Henkin, U.S. Ratification of Human Rights\nConventions: The Ghost of Senator Briker, 89 Am.

Plainly put, what\n\ndetermines whether a treaty is self-executing, or not, is the\n\nlanguage of the treaty as interpreted by the courts, not the nature\n\nof the rights established therein as opined by the Senate that\n\nratifies the treaty.\n\n             Thus, when placed within its proper perspective, the\n\nFoster   rule   simply   requires   courts   to   examine   the   treaty   in\n\nquestion to determine from its text (or when not apparent, from the\n\nhistory of the treaty), whether the treaty has created individual\n\nrights or whether it is non-self-executing, and therefore requires\n\nfurther legislative action to put it into effect domestically.\n\nSee, e.g., Abbott v.

Daniel Moynihan) (\"Even though\nthe Convention is non-self-executing, the[] [provisions of the\nICCPR] will now become binding obligations of the United States.\").\n\n                                   -73-\n\fthis declaration by the Senate is binding on the courts.                   The\n\ngovernment is wrong for several reasons.\n\n             First of all, a declaration is a statement of position by\n\nthe Senate that \"is not presented to the other international\n\nsignatories as a request for a modification of the treaty's terms.\"\n\nIgartúa III, 417 F.3d at 190 (Howard, J., dissenting).                  Thus a\n\ndeclaration is not part of the treaty, but instead \"is directed\n\nprimarily toward United States courts to express 'the sense of the\n\nSenate' that the treaty should . . . be interpreted [in the manner\n\nproposed by the Senate].\"         Id.\n\n             In the case of the ICCPR, the Senate also made several\n\nreservations, which were specifically directed at Articles 7, 10,\n\n15 and 20 of the ICCPR.41     A reservation is a \"unilateral statement\n\n. . . whereby . . . [a State] purports to exclude or to modify the\n\nlegal     effect   of   certain   provisions   of   the   treaty   in    their\n\napplication to that State.\"             Vienna Convention on the Law of\n\nTreaties, art. 2(1) (d) (May 23, 1969), 1155 U.N.T.S. 331.

There is no\n\nquestion that the Senate may hinge its consent to ratify a treaty\n\non a reservation.    See Haver v. Yaker, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 32, 35\n\n(1869); see also Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of\n\nthe United States § 314 cmt. d (1986) (noting that when the United\n\nStates accedes to a treaty with reservations, this statement has\n\ndomestic legal effect, whereas other indications that the President\n\nor Senate assigned a distinct meaning to the treaty, such as\n\ndeclarations, are only pertinent to treaty interpretation in \"the\n\nsame way that the legislative history of a statute is relevant\").\n\n          It   is   important   to   note    that   the   Senate   made   no\n\nreservations regarding the rights provided for in Article 25,42 or\n\nArticle 2 paragraphs 1,43 2,44 and 3.45\n\n\n     42\n          \"Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity\n. . .

The Senate has the unicameral\n          power only to consent to the ratification of\n          treaties, not to pass domestic legislation. A\n          declaration is not a part of a treaty in the\n          sense of modifying the legal obligations\n          created by it.    A declaration is merely an\n          expression of an interpretation or of a policy\n          or position. U.S. courts are . . . not bound\n          to apply expressions of opinion adopted by the\n          Senate (and concurred in by the President).\n          The   courts   must    undertake    their   own\n          examination of the terms and context of each\n          provision in a treaty to which the United\n          States is a party and decide whether it is\n          self executing.     The treaty is law. The\n          Senate's declaration is not law.

This is the\n\nunanimous view of treaty-law scholars.46\n\n          It is also the conclusion reached in the only case to\n\nhave directly passed upon this specific issue, Power Auth. of N.Y.\n\nv. Fed. Power Auth., 247 F.2d 538 (D.C. Cir. 1957), vacated as\n\nmoot, 355 U.S. 64 (1957).   In this case, the District of Columbia\n\nCourt of Appeals held that a \"reservation\"47 by the Senate in a\n\n\n     46\n          See, e.g.,     Louis Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the\nConstitution of the United States, 202 (2d ed. 1996) (describing\nthe Senate's practice of declaring treaties non-self-executing as\n\"anti-Constitutional in spirit\"); Henkin, supra note 15, at 346\n(arguing that non-self-executing declarations by the Senate may be\nunconstitutional); Cinotti, supra note 13, at 1291 (contending that\n\"the President and the Senate do not have constitutional authority\nto make a non-self-execution declaration legally binding\"); Jordan\nJ. Paust, Avoiding \"Fraudulent\" Executive Policy: Analysis of Non-\nSelf Execution of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 42\nDapple L. Rev. 1257, 1265 (1993) (quoting with approval the\nInternational Law Association's statement that it \"may well be that\na non-self-executing declaration . . . does not bind the judicial\nbranch\"); John Quigley, The International Covenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights and the Supremacy Clause, 42 Dapple L. Rev. 1287,\n1298 (1993) (arguing that courts, rather than the Senate, should\ndetermine whether or not a treaty is non-self-executing); see also\nCharles Dearborn, III, Note, The Domestic Legal Effect of\nDeclarations that Treaty Provisions Are Not Self-Executing, 57 Tex.\nL. Rev. 233, 251 (1979) (arguing that declarations might be \"an\ninvalid attempt by the Senate to enact domestic legislation without\nthe concurrence of the House\").\n     47\n          Although the opinion uses the term \"reservation\"\nthroughout, it is clear that what is involved is a \"declaration\" by\nthe Senate. Power Auth. of N.Y., 247 F.2d at 541 (calling the\n\n                                -77-\n\fbilateral     treaty    with    Canada     was     ineffective      because     the\n\n\"reservation\" (i.e., declaration) only involved U.S. domestic law.\n\nId. at 541.    For the reservation (i.e., declaration) to be binding\n\non the judiciary, the court reasoned, it had to constitute an\n\nactual part of the treaty:\n\n            A true reservation which becomes part of a\n            treaty is one which alters \"the effect of the\n            treaty in so far as it may apply in the\n            relations of (the) State or States which may\n            be parties to the Treaty.\" It creates \"a\n            different relationship between\" the parties\n            and varies \"the obligations of the parties\n            proposing it.\"\n\nId. (internal citations omitted). Because the \"reservation\" (i.e.,\n\ndeclaration)    was    merely    an    expression    of    the   Senate's     views\n\nconcerning domestic policy, it was not part of the treaty; and,\n\nergo, it did not become domestic law under the Supremacy Clause.\n\nAccordingly, it was not binding on the court.                    See also N.Y.\n\nIndians v. United States, 170 U.S. 1, 23 (1898) (\"The power to make\n\ntreaties is vested by the Constitution in the president and senate,\n\nand, while this proviso was adopted by the senate, there is no\n\nevidence that it ever received the sanction or approval of the\n\npresident. It cannot be considered as a legislative act, since the\n\npower to legislate is vested in the president, senate and house of\n\nrepresentatives.       There    is    something,    too,    which    shocks    the\n\nconscience in the idea that a treaty can be put forth as embodying\n\n\nSenate's statement a \"reservation\" but noting that the statement\n\"made no change in the treaty\" and was not a counter-offer\").\n\n                                       -78-\n\fthe terms of an arrangement with a foreign power or an Indian\n\ntribe, a material provision of which is unknown to one of the\n\ncontracting parties, and is kept in the background to be used by\n\nthe other only when the exigencies of a particular case may demand\n\nit.\").\n\n          More   recently,   the    Supreme   Court    has   affirmed   the\n\nseparate and distinct roles assigned to the Senate and Executive by\n\nthe Constitution under Article II.        In Medellín, the Court held\n\nthat an executive memorandum purporting to grant individuals rights\n\nunder a non-self-executing agreement was invalid because, while\n\n\"[t]he President has an array of political and diplomatic means\n\navailable to enforce international obligations . . . unilaterally\n\nconverting a non-self-executing treaty into a self-executing one is\n\nnot   among   them.    The   responsibility      for    transforming     an\n\ninternational obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty\n\ninto domestic law falls to Congress,\" through, for example, the\n\nenactment of implementing legislation.        552 U.S. at 525-26.       The\n\nCourt explained:\n\n          The requirement that Congress, rather than the\n          President, implement a non-self-executing\n          treaty   derives   from   the  text   of   the\n          Constitution, which divides the treaty-making\n          power between the President and the Senate.\n          The Constitution vests the President with the\n          authority to \"make\" a treaty.          If the\n          Executive determines that a treaty should have\n          domestic effect of its own force, that\n          determination may be implemented in \"mak[ing]\"\n          the treaty, by ensuring that it contains\n          language   plainly   providing  for   domestic\n\n                                   -79-\n\f          enforceability. If the treaty is to be\n          self-executing in this respect, the Senate\n          must consent to the treaty by the requisite\n          two-thirds vote, consistent with all other\n          constitutional restraints.\n\nId. at 526 (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).          Thus, as\n\nthe Supreme Court has reinforced, the constitutional prerogative to\n\n\"make\" treaties, and to set their domestic legal effect, falls in\n\nthe first instance to the executive.         While the Senate's views\n\nregarding self-execution may be relevant to the interpretation of\n\nan ambiguous treaty, see Stuart, 489 U.S. at 366-8; Restatement\n\n(Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 314, cmt.\n\nd (1987) (\"indication that . . . the Senate ascribed a particular\n\nmeaning to the treaty is relevant to the interpretation of the\n\ntreaty by a United States court in much the same way that the\n\nlegislative   history    of   a    statute    is    relevant      to   its\n\ninterpretation\"),48 those views are not capable of supplanting the\n\n\n     48\n          Nonetheless,   as   Justice    Scalia    points   out   in   his\nconcurrence in Stuart:\n\n          Of course the Senate has unquestioned power to\n          enforce its own understanding of treaties. It\n          may, in the form of a resolution, give its\n          consent on the basis of conditions. If these\n          are agreed to by the President and accepted by\n          the other contracting parties, they become\n          part of the treaty and of the law of the\n          United States. If they are not agreed to by\n          the President, his only constitutionally\n          permissible course is to decline to ratify the\n          treaty, and his ratification without the\n          conditions would presumably provide the basis\n          for impeachment. Moreover, if Congress does\n          not like the interpretation that a treaty has\n\n                                  -80-\n\fplain language of an agreement.   Stuart, 489 U.S. at 373 (Scalia,\n\nJ., concurring) (\"Only when a treaty provision is ambiguous have we\n\nfound it appropriate to give authoritative effect to extratextual\n\nmaterials.\"); see also Air France v. Saks, 470 U.S. 392, 399-400\n\n(1985); Nielsen v. Johnson, 279 U.S. 47, 52 (1929).\n\n          In conclusion, the declaration by the Senate to the\n\neffect that the ICCPR is non-self-executing is not binding on the\n\ncourts, which are required by the Supremacy Clause to make an\n\nindependent judgment of that issue, based on the language of the\n\ntreaty and, if that is not clear, on the negotiating history of the\n\ntreaty in question.\n\n          The en banc court's reliance on dicta49 in the Supreme\n\nCourt's Sosa decision to conclude otherwise was plainly erroneous.\n\nSee Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 150.     In relevant part, the issue in\n\n\n          been given by the courts or by the President,\n          it may abrogate or amend it as a matter of\n          internal law by simply enacting inconsistent\n          legislation. But it is a far cry from all of\n          this to say that the meaning of a treaty can\n          be determined, not by a reservation attached\n          to the President's ratification at the\n          instance of the Senate, nor even by formal\n          resolution of the Senate unmentioned in the\n          President's ratification, but by legislative\n          history of the sort that we have become\n          accustomed to using for purpose of determining\n          the meaning of domestic legislation.\n\n          Stuart, 489 U.S. at 375 (Scalia, J. concurring) (emphasis\n          added).\n     49\n          Even the lead opinion recognizes that Sosas's statement\nthat the ICCPR is non-self executing is dicta. See op. at 29.\n\n                               -81-\n\fSosa was whether the petitioner's detention violated customary\n\ninternational law and not the ICCPR.    See 542 U.S. at 735.      The\n\nquestion of the ICCPR's self-execution was never presented to the\n\nCourt; indeed, the petitioner expressly conceded that \"this treaty\n\nis not self-executing and may not be relied upon by individuals in\n\ndomestic court proceedings.\" Brief of Petitioner, Sosa v. Álvarez-\n\nMachain, 524 U.S. 692 (2004), No. 03-339, 2004 WL 162761 at 41.   As\n\nChief Justice Marshall aptly observed, \"[i]t is extremely dangerous\n\nto take general dicta upon supposed cases not considered in all\n\ntheir bearings, and, at best, inexplicitly stated as establishing\n\nimportant law principles.\" Alexander v. Baltimore Ins. Co., 8 U.S.\n\n370, 379 (1808).   The lead opinion's reliance on Sosa illustrates\n\nhis point.   In its haste to dispose of Appellant's treaty-based\n\nclaims, the en banc majority all but abandoned the Supreme Court's\n\nestablished plain-text approach to questions of self-execution, and\n\nturned on its head the Treaty Clause's careful separation of\n\npowers.   See U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2 (\"[The President]\n\nshall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,\n\nto make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present\n\nconcur . . . .\")\n\n          It is appropriate at this time to bypass and correct this\n\ndecision not only because, as admitted by the lead opinion, it was\n\nbased on dicta in Sosa, see op. at 29, but also because more recent\n\nSupreme Court precedent places its bare majority conclusions in\n\n\n                               -82-\n\fserious doubt. The political ties between the United States and its\n\nterritories have continued to evolve and have become ever more\n\nintegrated.   Cf. Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 758 (\"It may well be that\n\nover time the ties between the United States and any of its\n\nunincorporated      Territories    strengthen   in   ways   that   are   of\n\nconstitutional significance.\").            The only thing that has not\n\nchanged is the political inequality of the class of United States\n\ncitizens residing in Puerto Rico.          I would hold that the task of\n\ndetermining whether the ICCPR is self-executing, and gives rise to\n\nenforceable rights, is for the courts. The lead opinion's reliance\n\non dicta in Sosa essentially prevents that examination. As will be\n\nshown, recourse to the plain language of that treaty, and to its\n\ndrafting history, demonstrates that it is in fact a self-executing\n\nagreement that, upon ratification, became the Law of the Land and\n\nthus must be enforced by this court.\n\n                    (b)   The plain language of the ICCPR counsels\n                          that individual rights were created and that\n                          the United States agreed to provide a forum\n                          and remedies for the vindication of those\n                          rights to those of its citizens who claim a\n                          violation of those rights.\n\n            The text of the ICCPR unequivocally spells out individual\n\nrights and establishes the obligations of the contracting parties\n\nregarding   their    enforcement   by   individual   citizens   who   claim\n\nviolations of these rights.         A straightforward reading of this\n\nlanguage should leave little doubt that the United States has\n\nentered into an international agreement creating individual rights\n\n                                    -83-\n\fipso facto: at a minimum, the United States has agreed that\n\n\"[e]very citizen shall have the right and opportunity . . . [t]o\n\nvote . . . at genuine and periodic elections which shall be by\n\nuniversal and equal suffrage.\"    ICCPR art. 25, para. b (emphasis\n\nadded).   Upon ratification of this treaty by the Senate, these\n\nrights have become the supreme law of the land.        Further, the\n\nUnited States has agreed to provide an effective remedy for the\n\nviolation of these rights.   Id. art 2, para. 3 (emphasis added).\n\nMoreover, the United States \"undert[ook] to respect and ensure [the\n\nright to vote of] all individuals within its territory and subject\n\nto its jurisdiction . . . without distinction . . .\"    Id. at art.\n\n2, para. 1.    Further, it agreed \"that any person claiming such a\n\nremedy shall have the right thereto determined by competent,\n\njudicial, administrative, or legislative authorities, or by any\n\nother competent authority provided for by the legal system of the\n\nState, and to develop possibilities of judicial remedies.\" Id. art\n\n2, para. 3 (emphasis added).      Nonetheless, in contravention of\n\nthese obligations, the United States government has not only failed\n\nto act in support of the same, but it has actively obstructed their\n\nrealization.    See Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 175 (Torruella, J.,\n\ndissenting) (\"[I]t is an undisputed fact that, contrary to the\n\nrequirements of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the ICCPR, the United\n\nStates has taken no steps, to date, to implement the obligations\n\nundertaken therein.\").\n\n\n                                 -84-\n\f           There is nothing \"aspirational\" or \"precatory\" in the\n\nlanguage used by the treaty.              See Fund for Animals, Inc. v.\n\nKempthorne, 472 F.3d 872, 881 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (explaining that one\n\nway   courts    may   find   a   treaty   non-self-executing   is   if   its\n\n\"provisions are precatory, aspirational, or otherwise too vague to\n\nbe judicially enforceable\"); see also Edye v. Robertson, 112 U.S.\n\n580, 598-99 (1884) (\"A treaty ... is a law of the land as an act of\n\n[C]ongress is, whenever its provisions prescribe a rule by which\n\nthe rights of the private citizen or subject may be determined. And\n\nwhen such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court of\n\njustice, that court resorts to the treaty for a rule of decision\n\nfor the case before it as it would to a statute.\" (emphasis\n\nadded)).       Rather, it speaks to the establishment of specific\n\nindividual rights.      Compare ICCPR art. 25 (\"Every citizen shall\n\nhave the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions\n\nmentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions ...\n\n[t]o vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which\n\nshall be by universal and equal suffrage ... .\") (emphasis added),\n\nwith Jogi v. Voges, 480 F.3d 822, 833-4 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding\n\nthat Article 36.1(b) of the Vienna Convention, which \"states,\n\nplainly enough, that authorities 'shall inform the person concerned\n\nwithout delay of his rights under this sub-paragraph'\" confers\n\n\"individual rights,\" notwithstanding general language of preamble\n\nproviding that \"the purpose of [the Convention's] privileges and\n\n\n                                     -85-\n\fimmunities is not to benefit individuals\"), and British Caledonian\n\nAirways, Ltd. v.

Compare ICCPR art. 2 (United\nStates undertakes to \"ensure that any person whose rights or\nfreedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective\nremedy,\" and that \"any person claiming such a remedy shall have his\nright thereto determined by competent judicial, administrative or\nlegislative   authorities,\"   and   \"ensure   that  the   competent\nauthorities shall enforce such remedies when granted\"), with People\nof Saipan by Guerrero v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 502 F.2d 90, 97\n(9th Cir. 1974) (holding that Article 6 of Trusteeship Agreement\nwith Micronesia, which \"require[d] the United States to 'promote\nthe economic advancement and self-sufficiency of the inhabitants,\nand to this end ... regulate the use of natural resources' and to\n'protect the inhabitants against the loss of their lands and\nresources'\" gave rise to \"rights enforceable by an individual\nlitigant in a domestic court of law\" to challenge proposed\nconstruction of hotel on Trusteeship territory).\n\n                                -86-\n\fa defendant could invoke that statute to complain in court if he\n\nhad not been so informed.\").\n\n           The ICCPR's language certainly does not countenance the\n\nnarrow interpretation advocated by the government and by the lead\n\nopinion.   See, e.g., Stuart, 489 U.S. at 368 (\"[A] treaty should\n\ngenerally be construe[d] . . . liberally to give effect to the\n\npurpose which animates it and . . . [e]ven where a provision of a\n\ntreaty fairly admits of two constructions, one restricting, the\n\nother enlarging, rights which may be claimed under it, the more\n\nliberal interpretation is to be preferred . . . .\") (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); Asakura v.

Exec.\n\nRep. No. 102-23, at 19 (1992), reprinted in 31 I.L.M. 645 (1992);\n\nsee also id. at 10 (\"In general, the substantive provisions of the\n\n\n                                  -87-\n\fCovenant are consistent with the letter and spirit of the United\n\nStates Constitution, and laws, both state and federal.\").\n\n               Congress has in fact acted in partial compliance with its\n\nobligations under the ICCPR when, in 1961, just a few years after\n\nthe   United      Nations   first   ratified        the   ICCPR,    it    amended    our\n\nfundamental charter to allow the United States citizens who reside\n\nin the District of Columbia to vote for the Executive offices.                      See\n\nU.S. Const. amend. XXIII.51             Indeed, a bill is now pending in\n\nCongress       that    would    treat   the    District       of    Columbia   as    \"a\n\ncongressional district for purposes of representation in the House\n\nof Representatives,\" and permit United States citizens residing in\n\nthe capitol to vote for members of the House of Representatives.\n\nSee District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act, S. 160, 111th\n\nCong. (passed by Senate, February 26, 2009) (2009).52                     However, the\n\nUnited States has not taken similar \"steps\" with regard to the five\n\nmillion       United   States   citizens      who    reside    in   the    other    U.S.\n\nterritories, of which close to four million are residents of Puerto\n\nRico.        This inaction is in clear violation of the United States'\n\nobligations under the ICCPR.\n\n\n        51\n          Further, in 1977, the year in which the Carter\nadministration first submitted the ICCPR to the Senate for\nratification, Congress passed a proposed constitutional amendment\nthat would have granted the District of Columbia congressional\nvoting representation \"as if it were a state.\" See H.R.J. Res.\n554, 95th Cong., 92 Stat. 3795 (1978).\n      52\n          A similar bill was introduced in the House of\nRepresentatives on January 6, 2009. H.R. 157, 111th Cong.

See\n\ngenerally Bossuyt, supra note 16. Illustrative of this is the\n\nReport of the Commission on Human Rights, 5th Session (1949), 9th\n\nSession (1953), which addresses the formulation of political rights\n\nunder what eventually became article 25 of the ICCPR.           The report\n\nstates:\n\n           Two formulae were proposed: \"Every citizen\n           . . . shall be guaranteed by the State the\n           right and the opportunity [to vote]\" and\n           \"Every citizen shall have the right and the\n           opportunity [to vote],\" the former emphasizing\n           the obligation of the State, the latter the\n           rights of the citizen. The latter wording was\n           adopted.\n\nBossuyt, supra note 16, at 471 (internal citations omitted).\n\n           In a later discussion of Article 25, paragraph (b)\n\n(providing the right \"[t]o vote . . . at genuine periodic elections\n\nwhich shall be by universal and equal suffrage\"), the Report\n\nstates:\n\n           The various requirements of the article that\n           elections must be \"genuine,\" \"periodic,\" \"by\n           universal and equal suffrage,\" and \"by secret\n           ballot\" did not give rise to much discussion,\n           except for the words \"universal and equal\n           suffrage.\" The opinion was expressed that the\n           word \"universal\" was redundant in the light\n           of the introductory clause, \"Every citizen\n           shall have the right;\" so was the word\n           \"equal\", in view of the reference to the non-\n           discrimination clause of article 2.       The\n           majority,   however,   considered  that   the\n           principle of \"universal and equal suffrage\"\n\n                                   -89-\n\f            was a most fundamental one, and decided to\n            include it in the article. This provision, it\n            was thought, would leave States parties to the\n            Covenant free to regulate their own electoral\n            system, provided each vote carried equal\n            weight.\n\nId.   at   474-75   (internal   citations   omitted).     Article   25   was\n\napproved at the 1096th meeting of the Third Committee, 16th Session\n\n(1961), by a vote of 71 to none, with 4 abstentions.            See id. at\n\n477; A/C.3/SR.1096, § 79.\n\n            A proposal by the United States at the Second Session of\n\nthe Commission regarding the enforcement of the rights created by\n\nthe ICCPR pursuant to Article 2 also sheds light on the intentions\n\nof the United States regarding both the question of self-execution\n\nand the enforcement of these rights by the courts of the United\n\nStates.     In its proposal, E/CN.4/37, the United States moved to\n\nhave Article 2 read:\n\n            Each High Contracting         Party   is   under   an\n            obligation to ensure:\n\n            a) that its law secure to all persons under\n            its jurisdiction, including citizens . . .,\n            the enjoyment of these human rights and\n            fundamental freedoms;\n\n            b) that any person whose rights or freedoms\n            are violated shall have an effective remedy,\n            whether the violation has been committed by\n            persons acting in an official capacity;\n\n\n\n\n                                   -90-\n\f            c) that such remedies shall be enforceable by\n            a judiciary whose independence is secured\n            . . . .53\n\nBossuyt, supra note 16, at 49 (emphasis added) (quoting U.N. Doc\n\nE/CN.4/37).     Although this exact language was not approved, it\n\nshows what the United States was attempting to achieve through this\n\ntreaty.\n\n            The provision of effective remedies under Article 2 for\n\nviolation of the individual rights established by ICCPR was the\n\nsubject of much discussion and debate, and also reflects the intent\n\nof   the   contracting   parties,   including   the   United   States,   in\n\nenacting the ICCPR.       The representative of France was of the\n\nopinion that \"there was no need to specify the obligations of the\n\nStates parties in the event of a violation of the covenant, since\n\nit was obvious that if the States undertook to abide by the\n\ncovenant, they would have to provide for effective remedies against\n\n\n      53\n          Commission on Human Rights, 2nd Session (1947) (emphasis\nsupplied). At a later session of the Commission, the United States\nmade a proposal that would have inserted into paragraph 2 of\nArticle 2, a statement to the effect that \"[t]he provisions of this\nCovenant shall not themselves become effective as domestic law.\"\nSee Bossuyt, supra note 16, at 62 (quoting U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/224).\nThe United States \"contended that in some States a ratified treaty\nbecame the supreme law of the country in accordance with its\nconstitution,\" while \"[i]n others a treaty was not automatically\nincorporated in the national legislation, but its provisions had to\nbe included in legislation in order that they might become\nenforceable within the country.\" Id. Although the United States\nargued that its proposal was intended to put all the States on\nequal footing, its proposal was rejected. The Philippines made a\ncounter-proposal which provided the substance of the language of\nthe text eventually adopted. Amendment E/CN.4/318 (PI); see also\nBossuyt, supra note 16, at 62.\n\n                                    -91-\n\finfringements.\"       E/CN.4SR.125, p.4 (F); Bossuyt, supra note 16, at\n\n64 (discussing Commission on Human Rights, 5th Session (1949), 6th\n\nSession (1950), 8th Session (1952)).                  Great Britain, whose views\n\nwere   eventually         generally    accepted,       argued     that    \"the    proper\n\nenforcement of the provisions of the covenant depended on the\n\nguarantees     of    the     individual's       rights       against     abuse,    which\n\n[required the assurance of] the following elements: [1] possession\n\nof a legal remedy, [2] the granting of this remedy by national\n\nauthorities and [3] the enforcement of the remedy by the competent\n\nauthorities.\" E/CN.4/SR.125, p.8 (GB) (emphasis added);                      Bossuyt,\n\nsupra note 16, at 64.\n\n             These    views     were    reinforced          in   the   discussion    of\n\nParagraph    2(b)    of     Article    2.       As    originally       proposed,    this\n\nprovision stated that any person whose rights were violated would\n\nhave   his   or     her    rights     determined       by    competent     \"political,\n\nadministrative, or judicial\" authorities.                   Bossuyt, supra note 16,\n\nat 67 (quoting A12929, Ch. V, § 16).                 It was the opinion of some --\n\nincluding France, Egypt, Denmark, and the United States -- that\n\n\"all remedy should be provided through recourse to independent\n\njudicial authorities, which would include, where that was the case,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -92-\n\fadministrative tribunals.\"54   Bossuyt, supra note 16, at 67 (citing\n\nE/CN.4/SR 195 §6 (USA)).\n\n          It was considered particularly undesirable\n          that a person whose freedoms had been\n          violated, in all probability by the political\n          authorities of the State, should have his\n          right to a remedy determined by a political\n          organ, since the very same organ that had\n          violated his right might be the one that was\n          adjudicating his claim for a remedy.\n\nId. (citing E/CN.4/SR.138, §74-75 (USA)).55\n\n          The negotiating history of the ICCPR reinforces the clear\n\nlanguage of this treaty establishing individual, enforceable rights\n\non behalf of persons situated as are Appellants, and obligating the\n\nUnited States to provide a judicial remedy in its courts to\n\n\n     54\n          It should be noted that in many European legal systems\nand those modeled after them, including France, administrative\ntribunals play an important role in deciding what we normally\nconsider constitutional law in the United States.\n     55\n          This concern was again repeated before the Third\nCommittee's 18th Session in 1983 by the representatives from Great\nBritain, Italy, India and Australia, who sought to keep the\nremedies \"expressly reserved to an independent judiciary, and where\napplicable, to administrative tribunals.\" Id. at 69. Saudi Arabia\nthen proposed substituting \"legislative\" for \"political\" in the\noriginal language, A/C.3/SR.1259, §3 (SA) §10 (Chairman); Bossuyt,\nsupra note 16, at 69. After some parliamentary maneuvering, Saudi\nArabia's proposal was amended to read \"competent judicial,\nadministrative, or legislative or by any other competent authority\nprovided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the\npossibilities of a judicial remedy,\" thus allowing a remedy to be\ngranted by the executive, as well as by action of parliamentary\ncommissions or ad hoc legislation designed to remedy a specific\nwrong,   yet   avoiding   the  use   of   the   word   \"political.\"\nA/C.3/SR.1259, § 12 (SA), § 24 (UAR); Bossuyt, supra note 16, at\n69.

The doctrine\n\nhas been much criticized because it is applied ad hoc and is, in\n\neffect, a brand of judicial activism that abdicates the courts'\n\nconstitutional       responsibility         to    pass    upon     constitutional\n\nquestions.

Any\n\npolitical questions of relevance to this case have already been\n\ndecided by the appropriate political branches: the Executive, which\n\nnegotiated the terms of ICCPR, and Congress, which through the\n\nSenate exercised its constitutional prerogative of granting its\n\nadvice   and   consent   to   this   treaty.

But the effect of the ICCPR's self-executing\n\nprovisions is that Congress and the President have already granted\n\nthe United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico such rights.\n\nFurthermore, and more to the point, the United States has agreed\n\n\"to take the necessary steps, in accordance with its constitutional\n\n\n\n       57\n          Because Appellants are seeking to vindicate their rights\nunder the ICCPR -- which, as discussed, has become domestic law\nthrough operation of the Supremacy Clause and gives rise to\nenforceable, individual rights -- and because it is beyond dispute\nthat the ongoing denial of those rights is traceable to actions and\ninactions of the United States, the other elements of standing are\nclearly satisfied in this case.      See, e.g., United States v.\nThompson, 928 F.2d 1060, 1066 (11th Cir. 1991) (explaining that a\nself-executing treaty confers standing on \"an individual citizen to\n. . . protest a violation of the treaty\").\n\n                                    -97-\n\fprocesses and with the provisions of the [ICCPR], to adopt such\n\nlaws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the\n\nrights recognized in the [ICCPR].\" See ICCPR art. 2(2). It is\n\nbeyond cavil, nor does the government dispute, that no such steps\n\nhave been taken by the United States; in fact, the government\n\nclaims the U.S. does not have to take them because the ICCPR is\n\nineffective and legally nonexistent. Thus, by admission the United\n\nStates is in flagrant violation of its international commitments as\n\nwell as the Law of the Land.\n\n            We have the authority to declare as much.           See Franklin\n\nv. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802 (1972).                  In Franklin, a\n\nplaintiff challenged the method used by the Secretary of Commerce\n\nto calculate the population of each state for census purposes as\n\n\"arbitrary and capricious\" and contrary to certain statutes.                 Id.\n\nat 790-91.     In so doing, he sought to require the Secretary to\n\nrecalculate    the    population     numbers,   in   the     hope   that     this\n\nrecalculation would ultimately lead to a reapportionment that would\n\nassign an additional Representative to his own State.                  Id.   The\n\nCourt found that the plaintiff had stated a redressable injury. As\n\na plurality of the Court explained, \"even though [the Secretary]\n\ncannot herself change the reapportionment, she has an interest in\n\nlitigating its accuracy,\" and therefore, as a practical matter, \"we\n\nmay assume it is substantially likely that the President and other\n\nexecutive     and    congressional     officials     would     abide    by     an\n\n\n                                     -98-\n\fauthoritative     interpretation     of    the     census   statute   and\n\nconstitutional provision . . . even though they would not be\n\ndirectly bound by such a determination.\"           Id. at 803 (opinion of\n\nO'Connor, J.); see also Evans, 536 U.S. at 460 (noting that, in\n\nFranklin, \"[e]ight Members of the Court found that the plaintiff\n\nhad standing\").\n\n          Later, in Evans, the Court revisited this topic when the\n\nState of Utah sought an injunction ordering the Secretary              of\n\nCommerce to recalculate the 2000 census numbers and recertify the\n\nofficial result, believing that \"the Secretary's recertification,\n\nas a practical matter, would likely lead to a new, more favorable,\n\napportionment of Representatives.\"             536 U.S. at 460-61.     The\n\nSupreme Court rejected the argument that the plaintiff lacked a\n\nredressable injury because \"court-ordered relief\" could not extend\n\nbeyond   the    Secretary's   report      to     reapportionment   itself,\n\nexplaining:\n\n          [W]e believe it likely that Utah's victory\n          here would bring about the ultimate relief\n          that Utah seeks. Victory would mean a\n          declaration   leading,    or   an   injunction\n          requiring, the Secretary to substitute a new\n          \"report\" for the old one. Should the new\n          report contain a different conclusion about\n          the relative populations of North Carolina and\n          Utah, the relevant calculations and consequent\n          apportionment-related steps would be purely\n          mechanical . . . . Under these circumstances,\n          it would seem, as in Franklin, \"substantially\n          likely that the President and other executive\n          and congressional officials would abide by an\n          authoritative interpretation of the census\n          statute and constitutional provision . . . .\"\n\n                                   -99-\n\f            Moreover,   in   terms   of   our   \"standing\"\n            precedent, the courts would have ordered a\n            change in a legal status (that of the\n            \"report\"), and the practical consequence of\n            that change would amount to a significant\n            increase in the likelihood that the plaintiff\n            would obtain relief that directly redresses\n            the injury suffered. We have found standing in\n            similar circumstances.\n\nId. at 463-64 (citations omitted); Harrell v. Fla. Bar, 608 F.3d\n\n1241, 1260 (11th Cir. 2010) (\"Redressability is established . . .\n\nwhen a favorable decision \"would amount to a significant increase\n\nin the likelihood that the plaintiff would obtain relief that\n\ndirectly redresses the injury suffered. . . .\").\n\n            Here, too, the Appellants have sought a declaration of\n\ntheir rights, challenging the failure of the United States to give\n\neffect to the rights established under the ICCPR. A declaration to\n\nthat end, as in Franklin and Evans, would have the practical effect\n\nof making it \"substantially likely that the President and other\n\nexecutive    and   congressional     officials        would   abide\"     by    our\n\ninterpretation     of   the   law   and    proceed    to    act   favorably     on\n\nAppellants' claims thereafter.            Evans, 536 U.S. at 460 (quoting\n\nFranklin, 505 U.S. at 803).         Likewise, such a declaration would\n\neffect \"a change in a legal status\" which would significantly\n\nincrease the likelihood that the Appellants would obtain relief\n\nthat directly redresses the injury suffered.               Id. at 464.\n\n            Additionally,     Appellants     assert    that   they   have     been\n\ninjured by the failure of the United States to provide them with an\n\n\n                                    -100-\n\f\"effective remedy\" to cure their ongoing political inequality,\n\npursuant to Article 2 of the ICCPR.           They seek a declaration that\n\nthe United States is in violation of this independent obligation.\n\nOne form of relief available under the DJA is to \"'clarify[] and\n\nsettl[e] the legal relations in issue.'\"             Volvo Constr. Equip. N.\n\nAm., Inc. v. CLM Equip. Co., 386 F.3d 581, 594 (4th Cir. 2004)\n\n(quoting Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Quarles, 92 F.2d 321, 325\n\n(4th Cir. 1937)).        In Powell v. McCormack, for example, an elected\n\nMember    of    Congress    sued   various    officials   in    the   House    of\n\nRepresentatives, who had voted to exclude him from taking his seat\n\nin the 90th Congress as a result of various improprieties.                    395\n\nU.S.    486    (1969).     The   Supreme   Court   explicitly    rejected     the\n\nargument made by House officials that the case was nonjusticiable\n\nbecause the plaintiff had \"asked for coercive relief against the\n\nofficers of the House,\" and \"federal courts [could not] issue\n\nmandamus or injunctions compelling officers or employees of the\n\nHouse to perform specific official acts.\"            Id. at 517.   Rather, the\n\nCourt    held    that    regardless   of   whether   \"coercive     relief\"    was\n\navailable to the petitioners, the case was justiciable because the\n\nDJA \"provides that a district court may 'declare the rights . . .\n\nof any interested party . . . whether or not further relief is or\n\ncould be sought.'\"          Id. Likewise in this case, whether or not\n\n\"coercive relief\" is otherwise available, a declaration that the\n\nUnited States is in default of its obligations under the ICCPR to\n\n\n                                      -101-\n\fprovide Appellants with a means to redress their lack of political\n\nequality would, by clarifying the United States' obligations,\n\nresult   in    a     significant    increase     in   the   likelihood      that   the\n\nAppellants would obtain the remedy they seek.                 See Evans, 536 U.S.\n\nat 464 (citing FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 25 (1998) (standing to\n\nobtain court determination that the organization was a 'political\n\ncommittee' where that determination would make agency more likely\n\nto   require       reporting,      despite   agency's       power    not   to    order\n\nreporting); Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169-171 (1997) (similar\n\nwith respect to determination of the lawfulness of an agency's\n\nbiological report); Metro. Washington Airports Auth. v. Citizens\n\nfor Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 264-265 (1991)\n\n(similar in respect to determination that transfer of airport\n\ncontrol to local agency is unlawful)).\n\n              Past     experience     suggests    that      the   Supreme    Court's\n\npresumption that executive officials will abide by an authoritative\n\ndeclaration of United States law is a sound one.                       See Juda v.\n\nUnited States, 13 Cl. Ct. 667 (1987) (\"Juda II\"); see also                      Juda v.\n\nUnited States, 6 Cl. Ct. 441 (1984) (\"Juda I\").                     In Juda II, the\n\ncourt, invoking its duty to interpret international agreements,\n\npersuaded the political branches of government to take action\n\nconsistent with those agreements.                The issue in that case was\n\nwhether, as a matter of international law, the United States could\n\nunilaterally terminate its trusteeship over the Marshall Islands\n\n\n                                        -102-\n\fand other Pacific island territories, without securing the prior\n\napproval of the UN Security Council.          After stating what is by now\n\nan axiomatic constitutional rule, namely, that \"[c]ourts of the\n\nUnited States have final authority to interpret an international\n\nagreement for purposes of applying it as law in the United States,\"\n\nJuda II, 13 Cl. Ct. at 678, the court held that the actions of the\n\nPresident and Congress to resolve the status of the Pacific Island\n\nTrust Territories had resulted in de facto, but not de jure,\n\ncompliance by the United States with its treaty obligations.             Id.\n\nat 682.\n\n               The ruling granted declaratory relief to the citizens of\n\nthe trust territory who had challenged the validity of Presidential\n\nProclamation 5564, which had pronounced that the trusteeship was no\n\nlonger in effect.         Presidential Proclamation 5564, sec. 1, Fed.\n\nReg. 51, at 40399 (November 1986).             Although the court did not\n\ngrant, on other grounds, the specific relief requested by the trust\n\nterritory citizens, the court agreed that the Proclamation was not\n\nin compliance with international obligations of the United States,\n\nincluding the UN Charter.          Juda II, 13 Cl. Ct. at 678-682.\n\n               In response to this declaration, the United States took\n\nsteps     to    comply    with   these   international    obligations,   and\n\neventually sought and received the UN Security Council's approval\n\nfor its actions on November 10, 1992.            In the intervening seven-\n\nyear    period,     the   United    States    complied   with   the   Court's\n\n\n                                      -103-\n\fdisposition of the case, notwithstanding the fact that the Court\n\ndid not retain jurisdiction over the controversy.            The court also\n\nrejected the government's argument to the effect that the Insular\n\nCases58 precluded the application of the Constitution to the Trust\n\nTerritory, concluding instead that, even in a territory with a non-\n\ncitizen population, governed under a treaty with the United Nations\n\nrather than as a result of annexation (as in the case of Puerto\n\nRico),    \"[t]he    concept   that    the    Bill   of   Rights   and   other\n\nconstitutional protections against arbitrary government are to be\n\napplied selectively on a territorial basis cannot be justified in\n\nthe 1980's.\"       Juda I, 6 Cl. Ct. 441, 458 (1984).         This is good\n\nadvice which unfortunately has fallen on deaf ears in this Circuit.\n\n           As the Juda cases demonstrate, the argument made in the\n\npresent controversy, that a declaratory judgment may not proceed\n\nbecause there is a lack of an effective remedy, creating a non-\n\njusticiable case and controversy because there is no assurance that\n\nthe government or Congress will take any action based on such a\n\ndeclaration, is unavailing. As Juda shows, the contention that the\n\ngovernment would ignore a judgment declaring it in violation of its\n\nICCPR obligations, is, at best, entirely speculative, and speaks\n\n\n\n\n     58\n          De Lima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1 (1901); Goetze v. United\nStates, 182 U.S. 221 (1901); Dooley v. United States, 182 U.S. 222\n(1901); Armstrong v.

Cf. Defenders of\n\nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 564 n.2 (injury not redressable if \"the\n\nplaintiff alleges only an injury at some indefinite future time,\n\nand the acts necessary to make the injury happen are at least\n\npartly within the plaintiff's own control\"); City of Los Angeles v.\n\nLyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983) (denying declaratory relief that\n\nwould bar the use of chokeholds by police, because plaintiff could\n\nnot establish the likelihood that he would be personally subjected\n\nto a chokehold in the future, even though he had been so subjected\n\nin the past); Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 42\n\n(1976) (ultimate relief sought \"speculative\"); see also Steel Co.\n\nv.

Conclusion\n\n          As the Supreme Court has recognized:\n\n          No right is more precious in a free country\n          than that of having a voice in the election of\n          those who make the laws under which, as good\n          citizens, we must live.    Other rights, even\n          the most basic, are illusory if the right to\n          vote is undermined.\n\n                               -105-\n\fWesberry v.

Allowing\n\nthe creation of a second class of U.S citizens on a permanent, or\n\neven indefinite, basis is not a proper exercise of the power of\n\nCongress    under   the   Territorial   Clause60   or   the   Naturalization\n\nClause.61\n\n            The fact is that the United States assumed obligations\n\nunder the ICCPR that were undoubtedly aimed at the correction of\n\ninequality, and in particular, political inequality, among its\n\ncitizenry.    There is no question, nor does the government dispute,\n\nthat the United States has not complied with its obligations under\n\nthe ICCPR to recognize these rights, and to provide remedies for\n\ntheir enforcement when, and where, appropriate.

The\n\ndefendants are the United States, as well as the President of the\n\nUnited States, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Clerk of the\n\nUnited States House of Representatives, all in their official\n\ncapacities. Among the remedies Igartúa seeks is an order directing\n\nthese   officials   to   \"take   all    the   necessary   steps   .    .   .    to\n\nimplement[] the apportionment of Representatives [in the] electoral\n\nprocess to Puerto Rico.\"\n\n           The district court dismissed the complaint.            See Igartua\n\nv. United States, No. 08-1174 (D.P.R. June 3, 2009).              On de novo\n\nreview, we affirm the dismissal. The text of the U.S. Constitution\n\ngrants the ability to choose, and so to vote for, members of the\n\nHouse of Representatives to \"the People of the several States.\"\n\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 2.

Igartúa's claim that\n\ninternational law requires a contrary result is foreclosed by our\n\ndecision   in     the   last     case    Igartúa     brought   before   us.   See\n\nIgartúa-de la Rosa v.

The case was properly dismissed.\n\n            The    panel    is    unanimous     in    agreeing   that   the   U.S.\n\nConstitution does not give Puerto Rico residents the right to vote\n\nfor members of the House of Representatives because Puerto Rico is\n\nnot a state.\n\n            Chief Judge Lynch and Judge Lipez conclude that this\n\npanel is bound by Igartúa III's holding that the Constitution does\n\nnot permit granting such a right to the plaintiffs by means other\n\nthan those specified for achieving statehood or by amendment.\n\nChief Judge Lynch independently concludes that this holding in\n\nIgartúa III is correct.          Judge Lipez considers the panel bound by\n\nthis holding in Igartúa III, but he does not express a view of his\n\nown on its merit.         Chief Judge Lynch and Judge Lipez agree that\n\nIgartúa III requires dismissal of plaintiffs' claims based on\n\ntreaties and international law. Judge Lipez joins the holding that\n\ndismissal of the case is affirmed. He joins this introduction, the\n\nintroduction to Section II, Sections II.A, II.B, and II.C.1, and\n\nSection    III    of    Chief    Judge    Lynch's     opinion.

In three earlier decisions, including an en\n\nbanc decision, this court rejected Igartúa's analogous claims that\n\nPuerto   Rican    U.S.   citizen-residents   have    a   right   to   vote   in\n\nelections for President and Vice President of the United States.\n\nSee Igartúa III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Igartúa de la Rosa v.

These cases inform our\n\nanalysis of this admittedly different, but related question.\n\n           Igartúa's arguments are unavailing.           First, the text of\n\nthe Constitution, in several provisions, plainly limits the right\n\nto choose members of the House of Representatives to citizens of a\n\nstate.   Second, the constitutional text is entirely unambiguous as\n\nto what constitutes statehood; the Constitution explicitly recites\n\nthe thirteen original states as being the states and articulates a\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fclear mechanism for the admission of other states, as distinct from\n\nterritories.     Puerto Rico does not meet these criteria.    Third,\n\nthese provisions of the constitutional text are deliberate and go\n\nto the heart of the Constitution.      This deliberate constitutional\n\nframework may not be upset.\n\n          This Section addresses these points, which require the\n\ndismissal of plaintiffs' complaint.     The subsequent Sections turn\n\nto the additional arguments raised by Igartúa and the government of\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n          The analysis of Igartúa's constitutional claims begins\n\nwith the pertinent text of the U.S. Constitution as to the U.S.\n\nHouse of Representatives.     This language is different from that\n\ngoverning the ability to vote for President, which was at issue in\n\nIgartúa III.\n\n          The text of the Constitution refers directly to the\n\nelection of members of the House of Representatives in Article I,\n\nArticle II, and the Fourteenth Amendment.        Article I reads, in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n          The House of Representatives shall be composed\n          of Members chosen every second Year by the\n          People of the several States, and the Electors\n          in each State shall have the Qualifications\n          requisite for Electors of the most numerous\n          Branch of the State Legislature.\n\n          No person shall be a Representative who shall\n          not have attained to the Age of twenty five\n          Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the\n          United States, and who shall not, when\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in\n            which he shall be chosen.\n\n            Representatives . . . shall be apportioned\n            among the several States which may be included\n            within   this   Union,  according   to   their\n            respective Numbers . . . .      The Number of\n            Representatives shall not exceed one for every\n            thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at\n            Least one Representative . . . .\n\n            When vacancies happen in the Representation\n            from any State, the Executive Authority\n            thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill\n            such Vacancies.\n\n            . . . .\n\n            The Times, Places and Manner of holding\n            Elections for Senators and Representatives,\n            shall be prescribed in each State by the\n            Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at\n            any   time  by   Law  make  or   alter  such\n            Regulations, except as to the Places of\n            Chusing Senators.\n\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 1-4 (emphasis added); id. § 4, cl. 1\n\n(emphasis   added).   Article   I   itself   uses   the   term   \"State\"   or\n\n\"States\" eight times when defining and outlining the House of\n\nRepresentatives.\n\n            In addition to Article I, Article II, when referring to\n\nthe election of the President, reads:\n\n            Each State shall appoint . . . a Number of\n            Electors, equal to the whole Number of\n            Senators and Representatives to which the\n            State may be entitled in the Congress.\n\nId. art. II, § 1, cl. 2 (emphasis added).       This reinforces the link\n\nbetween statehood and the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f              Further, the Fourteenth Amendment, when describing the\n\napportionment of Representatives, states:\n\n              Representatives shall be apportioned among the\n              several States according to their respective\n              numbers, counting the whole number of persons\n              in each State . . . .\n\nId. amend. XIV, § 2 (emphasis added).               The amendment process has\n\nbeen used to reinforce, not to alter, the original text that\n\nRepresentatives come from the states.\n\n              The text of Article I is clear that only the people of a\n\nstate may choose the members of the House of Representatives from\n\nthat state.         Id. art. I, § 2, cl. 1 (\"The House of Representatives\n\nshall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People\n\nof the several States.\").            We reject Igartúa's argument that this\n\ntext refers only to \"People\" and that we may ignore the express\n\nlimitation on representation to \"People of the several States.\"\n\nId. (emphasis added).1            Our conclusion is reinforced by Article I,\n\nSection 2, Clauses 2 through 4, as well as by Article I, Section 4,\n\nArticle II, Clause 2, and Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nwhich       again    refer   to     states   in   describing   the   number   of\n\nRepresentatives, their apportionment, and the setting of elections.\n\n              The text of the Constitution defines the term \"State\" and\n\naffords no flexibility as to its meaning.             The term is unambiguous\n\n\n\n        1\n          The term \"People\" clarifies that Representatives are not\nto be chosen by state legislatures. Seth Lipsky, The Citizen's\nConstitution 5 n.12 (2009).\n\n                                         -7-\n\fand refers to the thirteen original states, which are specifically\n\nnamed in Article I, Section 2, id. art.

Puerto Rico\n\nfits in none of these categories.\n\n            Because Puerto Rico is not a state, it may not have a\n\nmember of the House of Representatives.           Id. art.

IV, § 3, cl. 1.                     The limitation\n\non representation in the House to the people of the states was\n\nquite deliberate and part of the Great Compromise.                           The Great\n\nCompromise, which enabled the fledgling states to move beyond loose\n\naffiliation and achieve nationhood, depended precisely on this firm\n\ndefinition    of   a     \"State.\"         The     Framers     appeared        at     the\n\nConstitutional     Convention     as   representatives           of    the    thirteen\n\nindividual    states.3      See     Max    Farrand,     The      Framing       of    the\n\nConstitution of the United States 10-11 (1913).                  Disputes between\n\ndelegates from more and less populous states regarding how to\n\nstructure congressional representation brought the convention to a\n\nstandstill.    Id. at 97.\n\n          The Great Compromise broke the deadlock, by providing\n\nthat \"the People of the several States\" would be represented in\n\nproportion    to   their    several       populations       in        the    House   of\n\nRepresentatives, whereas the Senate would have two senators per\n\nstate, regardless of the state's population.

As the government puts the argument,\n\nthe Commonwealth \"does not need to be a State of the Union to be\n\nentitled to representation in the House of Representatives.\"\n\n             The government of Puerto Rico further urges that the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Boumediene v. Bush, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145795\"><a href=\"/opinion/145795/boumediene-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2008), decided after Igartúa III, supports its argument and\n\nsupersedes our reasoning in rejecting that very claim in Igartúa\n\nIII.       The government argues that the relationship between the\n\nUnited States and Puerto Rico has so strengthened in ways which are\n\nconstitutionally significant under Boumediene that Puerto Rico is\n\n\"de facto\" a state for Article I House of Representative purposes.\n\nThe government also argues that it is inherent in the grant of\n\nAmerican citizenship to the residents of Puerto Rico that they be\n\nafforded the \"right to elect voting representatives to the House of\n\nRepresentatives.\"\n\n             Finally, Igartúa asserts that international agreements\n\nand treaties as well as customary international law require that\n\nhis claim be granted.      Such arguments were rejected before, and\n\nthey do not succeed here.6\n\n\n       6\n          We also reject the argument made by Igartúa, but not made\nby the government, that this case must be heard by a three-judge\ndistrict court under 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a). That statute provides\n\n                                 -12-\n\fA.          The Government of Puerto Rico's Argument That the\n            Commonwealth Must Be Treated as the Functional Equivalent\n            of a State for Purposes of Article I Fails\n\n            The government of Puerto Rico recognizes that the claim\n\nthat Puerto Rico is the functional equivalent of a state was\n\navailable at the time of Igartúa III, even if not made then as\n\nexplicitly as it is made in this case.

No constitutional text vests the power to amend or the power\n\nto create a new state in the federal courts.      No such power is\n\ngranted to the courts by Article III, which creates and limits the\n\njurisdiction of the federal courts.

Bush Is Incorrect\n\n           The government of Puerto Rico also argues that the\n\nSupreme Court's 2008 decision in Boumediene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145795\"><a href=\"/opinion/145795/boumediene-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, supports\n\nthe adoption of a \"de facto\" test for statehood and requires\n\nrethinking of the conclusion reached in Igartúa III.     Boumediene\n\ndoes no such thing.\n\n           Boumediene addressed whether aliens designated as enemy\n\ncombatants and detained at the United States Naval Station at\n\nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, \"have the constitutional privilege of habeas\n\ncorpus, a privilege not to be withdrawn except in conformance with\n\nthe Suspension Clause.\"    Id. at 732.   The case has nothing to do\n\nwith whether U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico may vote for\n\nmembers of the House of Representatives or whether Puerto Rico\n\nshould be treated as a state for House of Representatives purposes.\n\n           The government argues that Boumediene has nonetheless\n\nestablished a \"de facto\" test governing whether U.S. citizens\n\nresiding in Puerto Rico may vote for and have a Representative in\n\n                                -15-\n\fthe House of Representatives.              It is not entirely clear from the\n\ngovernment's argument whether the content of this proposed \"de\n\nfacto\"    test    is    different     in    substance    from     the   \"functional\n\nequivalent\" test we rejected above.\n\n            The    government       of     Puerto   Rico's    claim     is    that   in\n\nBoumediene the Supreme Court \"in effect revisited its position\n\nregarding the rights of those residing in territories of the United\n\nStates.\"    The government cites out of context to several of the\n\nSupreme Court's statements in that case.                 The government relies\n\nheavily    on     the      Court's       observation     that      \"questions        of\n\nextraterritoriality        turn     on     objective    factors    and       practical\n\nconcerns, not formalism.\"           Id. at 764.     The government argues that\n\nthe Court described the Insular Cases as applying to territories\n\n\"with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions that Congress\n\nintended    to    govern    only     temporarily,\"      id.   at   759       (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted), and notes the Court's recognition that\n\n\"[i]t may well be that over time the ties between the United States\n\nand any of its unincorporated territories strengthen in ways that\n\nare of constitutional significance,\" id. at 758.\n\n            On the basis of these quotations, concerned with an\n\nentirely different question, the government argues that the Supreme\n\nCourt has adopted a functional, de facto approach to all questions\n\nof the effect of territorial status.                It further argues that the\n\ndegree of integration between Puerto Rico and the United States has\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\fled to a relationship that is comparable to the relationship\n\nbetween the national government and one of the fifty \"de jure\"\n\nstates of the Union.\n\n           The government's argument both misapplies Boumediene and\n\noverreaches. As the United States points out, the Boumediene court\n\nwas concerned only with the Suspension Clause, U.S. Const. art. I,\n\n§ 9, cl. 2, and not with Article I, Section 2, or any other\n\nconstitutional text.       No question is raised in this case about the\n\nextraterritorial availability of habeas corpus under the Suspension\n\nClause.8    To   the   extent      a    de    facto    analysis      may     govern   the\n\navailability of the writ of habeas corpus for aliens designated as\n\nenemy combatants and held at Guantanamo, there was no claim in\n\nBoumediene that Guantanamo was a state of the United States.\n\nFurther,   unlike   Article        I,   Section       2,    the   Suspension     Clause\n\ncontains   no    mention     of    the       \"States,\"      nor    is   it    otherwise\n\ngeographically limited.       Id.\n\n           Boumediene did not hold that courts may disregard the\n\nexplicit   language     in        the    text    of        the    Constitution        that\n\nrepresentation in the House is given to \"the People of the several\n\nStates.\"   Nor did the Supreme Court hold that all provisions of the\n\nConstitution, regardless of constitutional text, may be applied\n\nwithout regard to whether a state is involved.

What is clear is that the\n\nCommonwealth     \"is   not    a   'state'   within   the   meaning   of   the\n\nConstitution.\"     Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 147.           Even if the ties\n\nbetween the United States and Puerto Rico were strengthened in ways\n\nthat might have some constitutional significance as to habeas\n\ncorpus, that would have no bearing on the Article I question before\n\nus.\n\n           Moreover, an earlier line of Supreme Court cases, not\n\noverruled by Boumediene, plainly rejected the \"de facto\" approach,\n\nwhich the government urges, to determining what qualifies as a\n\nstate.   As early as 1805, Chief Justice Marshall rejected a claim\n\nby residents of the District of Columbia that the Court should\n\ntreat the District as a state because it met some political\n\ntheorists' definition of a \"state,\" that is, a discrete political\n\nsociety.   Hepburn & Dundas v. Ellzey, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 445, 445-\n\n46, 452-53 (1805).           Chief Justice Marshall explicitly quoted\n\nArticle I's language concerning the election of Representatives \"by\n\nthe people of the several states\" as evidence \"that the word state\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fis used in the constitution as designating a member of the union,\n\nand excludes from the term the signification attached to it by\n\nwriters on the law of nations.\"      Id. at 452-53.\n\n          The Supreme Court applied similar reasoning in two later\n\nnineteenth century cases to reject arguments by residents of the\n\nFlorida and Mississippi territories that these territories should\n\nbe treated as states.   Am. Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 26 U.S.\n\n(1 Pet.) 511, 542 (1828) (noting that residents of Florida \"do not\n\n. . . participate in political power\" and \"do not share in the\n\ngovernment, until Florida shall become a state\"); Corp. of New\n\nOrleans v. Winter, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 91, 94 (1816) (\"It has been\n\nattempted to distinguish a Territory from the district of Columbia;\n\nbut the court is of opinion, that this distinction cannot be\n\nmaintained . . . [N]either of them is a state, in the sense in\n\nwhich that term is used in the constitution.\").\n\n          More   recently,   the    Supreme   Court   has   affirmed   the\n\nrejection of variations on both the \"functional equivalent\" and the\n\n\"de facto\" arguments made here.

U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2.           Under\n\nother provisions of the Constitution, however, the right to vote is\n\ngiven   to    residents      of   the    States,   not   to   citizens.     Hence,\n\n\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\fcitizenship alone does not trigger the right               to vote.9     The\n\ngovernment's argument therefore fails.\n\nC.          Igartúa's Arguments About Treaty and International Law\n            Obligations Are Without Merit\n\n            Igartúa urges that the United States must meet certain\n\nobligations under international agreements, treaties, and customary\n\ninternational law, including the obligation to provide him a vote\n\nfor Representatives to the United States House of Representatives.10\n\nIn particular, Igartúa relies on portions of (1) the International\n\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, opened for signature Dec.\n\n16, 1966, 999 U.N.T.S. 171; (2) the Universal Declaration of Human\n\nRights, G.A.

OEA/Ser.P/AG/RES.1 (XXVIII-E/01)\n\n\n     9\n          The caselaw cited by the government of Puerto Rico\nillustrates the point. The Supreme Court has often emphasized the\nimportance of the right to vote. See, e.g., Burson v.

If an\n\ninternational norm of democratic governance exists, we held, \"it is\n\nat   a   level    of   generality   so    high      as   to     be   unsuitable    for\n\nimportation into domestic law.\"           Id.       The same reasoning applies\n\nhere. Neither international agreements nor customary international\n\nlaw mandates that residents of Puerto Rico who are U.S. citizens be\n\nable to vote for members of the House of Representatives.\n\n            The dissent goes beyond the claims made by the parties\n\nwith respect to one international agreement.                    The dissent argues,\n\nas   though      the   issues   were     open    in      this    court,   that     the\n\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) both\n\nis a \"self-executing\" treaty and that it creates individual rights\n\nenforceable in federal courts.           But these issues are not open.\n\n            1.    Igartúa III Binds the Court\n\n            We are bound by the en banc court's decision in Igartúa\n\nIII, which expressly opined on these issues. That decision reached\n\nthree relevant conclusions: (1) treaty obligations do not override\n\nthe Constitution; (2) the international agreements at issue in\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fIgartúa III, including the ICCPR, do not constitute domestic law\n\nbecause they are not self-executing and Congress has not enacted\n\nimplementing legislation; and (3) there were other problems with\n\nthe treaty claims in Igartúa III, including personal standing and\n\nredressability.       Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 148-150.   Without more,\n\nIgartúa III thus forecloses us from considering the treaty-based\n\nclaims in this case.11\n\n             2.    The Dissent Relies on Waived and Forfeited Arguments\n\n             The dissent's argument that the ICCPR creates rights\n\nunder domestic law extends beyond the claims before this court.\n\nArguments that are intentionally relinquished or abandoned are\n\nwaived, and arguments that are not raised in a timely manner are\n\nforfeited.

Id. at 8.\n\n            Igartúa and the government of Puerto Rico do not claim\n\nthat the ICCPR is a self-executing treaty or that the ICCPR\n\noverrides   Article    I   of   the    Constitution   by   operation   of   the\n\nSupremacy Clause.      The government of Puerto Rico made an express\n\nchoice not to join these arguments, thereby both waiving and\n\nforfeiting them.      Igartúa contends that each agreement he invokes\n\n\"requires the signatory country to provide a judicial remedy for\n\nclaims of citizens invoking rights under it.\"               But he does not\n\nsupport this contention with argument as to how the agreements bind\n\nfederal courts.     Igartúa cites the ICCPR merely \"as supportive,\"\n\nnoting that it has \"been used by many courts to interpret existing\n\nU.S. law or to determine legal rights when the plaintiff has an\n\nindependent cause of action\"           (emphasis added).     This amounts to\n\nforfeiture if not waiver.\n\n            The dissent fails to recognize this waiver or forfeiture,\n\nand fails to meet the conditions for considering the arguments.\n\n            3.

Our conclusions here are a required result\n\nof the judicial function under Medellín, and are not judicial\n\nactivism in any sense.\n\n          In our analysis of the ICCPR in Igartúa III, we began\n\nwith the text of the treaty.       We stated that nothing in the\n\ntreaties at issue in Igartúa III, including the ICCPR, \"says\n\n\n     12\n          The dissent argues that Igartúa does not possess the\nconstitutional right he asserts, but argues that Congress could\nextend the franchise to the citizens of Puerto Rico without making\nPuerto Rico a state or ratifying a constitutional amendment. As\nexplained above, this argument is foreclosed by our en banc\ndecision in Igartúa III. The dissent makes three arguments, each\nof which lacks merit.\n     First, the dissent cites caselaw that existed when we decided\nIgartúa III. Second, the dissent suggests that Congress is not\nlimited by Article I when it implements a treaty obligation, citing\nMissouri v. Holland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99561\"><a href=\"/opinion/99561/missouri-v-holland/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1920). Neither plaintiff nor\nthe Commonwealth make this argument. But even if the argument were\nnot waived, Holland does not sweep so broadly. That decision held\nthat Congress may legislate beyond its Commerce Clause power to\nimplement a treaty. Holland, 452 U.S. at 432-33. It did not hold\nthat Congress may disregard Article I's structural provisions\ngoverning the election of Representatives, not to mention similar\nprovisions in Article II and the Fourteenth Amendment.\n     Third, the dissent contends that the Framers did not intend to\nimbue the distinction between a \"state\" and a \"territory\" in the\nConstitution with any meaning.      This claim, like much of the\ndissent's argument, ignores that this court is an inferior court\nsubject to Supreme Court precedent.      There is no dispute that\nSupreme Court doctrine has long distinguished between the\nConstitution's treatment of states and territories      See, e.g.,\nBoumediene v.

Alvarez-Machain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137006\"><a href=\"/opinion/137006/sosa-v-alvarez-machain/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).      Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 150.   In Sosa, the Supreme\n\nCourt   relied    upon   congressional   statements   accompanying   the\n\nSenate's   ratification of the ICCPR.     Sosa, 542 U.S. at 728, 735.\n\nWe then looked to those congressional statements.        We wrote that\n\nthe ICCPR \"was submitted and ratified on the express condition that\n\nit would be 'not self-executing.'\"       Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 150\n\n(quoting 138 Cong. Rec.

Our reasoning thus rested on not only the text of the\n\nICCPR but the positions of all three branches of government.\n\n           Medellín explicitly ratified Igartúa III's analysis of\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fself-executing treaties.      In Medellín, the Supreme Court held that\n\nwhether a treaty is self-executing depends upon the language of\n\nimplementing statutes and the language of the treaty ratified by\n\nthe Senate.   Medellín, 552 U.S. at 505.            It summarized this holding\n\nby quoting Igartúa III's conclusion that treaties \"are not domestic\n\nlaw unless Congress has either enacted implementing statutes or the\n\ntreaty itself conveys an intention that it be 'self-executing' and\n\nis ratified on these terms.\"        Id. (quoting Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at\n\n150) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Medellín adds further weight to this court's deference to\n\nthe political branches in construing treaties like the ICCPR.\n\nMedellín   emphasized    that       the    courts       may   not    supplant     the\n\nconstitutional    role   of   the    political       branches       in   making   and\n\napproving treaties.       Id. at 515.              It gave deference to the\n\nexecutive branch's interpretation of whether the treaty at issue in\n\nthat case was domestically enforceable.                 Id. at 513.       The Court\n\ntempered   that   deference     to    the     executive       in    light    of   the\n\nlegislative role in transforming an international obligation from\n\n\"a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law.\"                         Id. at 525\n\n(citing Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 150).\n\n           This court's holding in Igartúa III that the ICCPR is not\n\na   self-executing   treaty   thus        stands   on    strengthened       ground.13\n\n\n      13\n          Contrary to Igartúa and the dissent's assertions, the\nSupreme Court's engagement with international law in Abbott v.\nAbbott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"146554\"><a href=\"/opinion/146554/abbott-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Supreme Court has not contradicted its statement in\n\nSosa that the ICCPR is not self-executing.14      It follows that our\n\nconclusion that the ICCPR is not a self-executing treaty still\n\nrests on the positions of all three branches of government.\n\n            b.

As I shall explain, if each of those\n\nissues were decided in plaintiffs' favor, United States citizens\n\nresiding in Puerto Rico would have a viable claim to equal voting\n\nrights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political\n\nRights (\"ICCPR\").\n\n               Thus, while I agree with Chief Judge Lynch that our panel\n\nmust adhere to the precedent set five years ago by the en banc\n\ncourt    on    the   constitutional          and    treaty    interpretation         issues\n\naddressed       in   the     majority    opinion,      I     cannot    agree    that    the\n\nplaintiffs' claims should be dismissed without review by the full\n\ncourt.     Given the magnitude of the issues and Judge Torruella's\n\n\n                                             -32-\n\fforceful     analysis,         this    is    one    of    those    rare    occasions   when\n\nreconsideration of an en banc ruling is warranted.\n\n                             I. The Constitutional Argument\n\n                 In    the    2005    en     banc,       the    majority    rejected    the\n\nplaintiffs'           contention      that    the    Constitution         required   giving\n\ncitizens who reside in Puerto Rico the right to vote for President\n\nand Vice President of the United States.

In this appeal, the plaintiffs attempt to distinguish\n\npresidential and vice-presidential voting from the election of\n\nmembers of the House of Representatives, emphasizing that the\n\nlatter      is    governed       by   a     different      constitutional      provision.\n\nCompare U.S. Const. art. II, § 1, cl. 2 with id. art. I, § 2, cl.\n\n1.16\n\n\n       16\n          Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 describes the process for\nelecting the President and Vice President, in part, as follows:\n\n                 Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as\n                 the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number\n                 of Electors, equal to the whole Number of\n                 Senators and Representatives to which the\n                 State may be entitled in the Congress . . . .\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment specifies that the electors shall meet \"in\ntheir respective states\" to cast ballots for President and Vice\nPresident. U.S. Const. amend. XII.\n\n       Article I, Section 2, Clause 1 provides:\n\n                 The House of Representatives shall be composed\n                 of Members chosen every second Year by the\n                 People of the several States, and the Electors\n                 in each State shall have the Qualifications\n\n                                              -33-\n\f             That distinction makes no difference, however, because\n\nthe    two   constitutional     provisions      similarly    enfranchise          only\n\nindividuals residing in \"States.\"               Since Puerto Rico is not a\n\n\"State,\" the 2005 en banc decision precludes us from holding that\n\nthe Constitution requires extending the right to vote for full-\n\nstatus members of the House of Representatives to the residents of\n\nPuerto Rico.       Moreover, if the issue were before us as a matter of\n\nfirst impression, I would join my colleagues in concluding that the\n\ndenial of that right to Puerto Rico citizens does not violate\n\nArticle I, Section 2 of the Constitution.\n\n             To say that the Constitution does not require extension\n\nof    federal   voting     rights   to   Puerto   Rico    residents      does     not,\n\nhowever, exclude the possibility that the Constitution may permit\n\ntheir enfranchisement under another source of law.                      The 2005 en\n\nbanc    majority    also    concluded,     at   least    implicitly,      that     the\n\nConstitution     prohibits     enfranchising      Puerto    Rico    residents       in\n\npresidential       elections    because     the   privilege        of    voting     is\n\nrestricted to electors who are chosen by citizens of \"State[s].\"\n\nSee Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 148 (noting that \"the franchise for\n\nchoosing electors is confined to 'states'\") (emphasis added).\n\nBecause Article I, Section 2 defines those eligible to vote for\n\nmembers of the House in that similarly narrow way, Igartúa III's\n\n\n\n             requisite for Electors of the most numerous\n             Branch of the State Legislature.\n\n                                         -34-\n\fholding is also binding in this appeal on the question whether the\n\nConstitution \"confine[s]\" voting for members of Congress to State\n\nresidents.\n\n            I have doubts, however, about the correctness of the\n\njudgment that the Constitution allows only citizens who reside in\n\nstates to vote.       To be sure, the unstated premise of my concurrence\n\nin the 2005 en banc was that the Constitution restricted the right\n\nto vote to residents of states.         My view was – and remains – that\n\nthe plaintiffs' claims under the ICCPR are not justiciable if the\n\nConstitution itself prohibits equal voting rights for Puerto Rico\n\nresidents.    A constitutional amendment or Puerto Rico's admission\n\nas a state would then be the only ways to remove the barrier.                See\n\nIgartúa III, 417 F.3d at 153 (Lipez, J., concurring).              I concluded\n\nthat, in such circumstances, even if the plaintiffs' arguments had\n\nmerit as a matter of treaty interpretation, court intervention\n\nwould be inappropriate because the possibility of a remedy would be\n\noverly speculative.       Id. at 158.\n\n            Indeed, and perhaps more to the point, it would be\n\nmeaningless for a court to consider whether the United States is in\n\nviolation     of   a    treaty    provision    that    conflicts      with   the\n\nConstitution.      The Constitution trumps the treaty and, if a treaty\n\npurports to do something the Constitution forbids, a court would\n\nhave   no    choice    but   to   conclude    that    the   treaty,    not   the\n\nConstitution, must give way.        Saying or doing more than that would\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fbe inappropriate; it is not the court's role to tell the federal\n\ngovernment how to meet international obligations in the face of a\n\nconstitutional prohibition.

If the Constitution does not\n\nprohibit extending the right to vote to citizens who reside outside\n\n\"the several States,\" an enforceable treaty could provide the\n\ngoverning domestic law on that issue.

VI, cl. 2.       This is not a view of the ICCPR\n\nthat I contemplated in 2005, but it is one that I now consider\n\nworthy of serious examination.\n\n          As   Judge   Torruella    points    out,   the   view   that   the\n\nConstitution does not necessarily forbid extensions of the rights\n\nit delineates has been articulated in scholarly writing, and it\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\funderlies the effort to legislate voting rights for residents of\n\nthe District of Columbia.             See Opinion of Torruella, J.; see also\n\nJosé R. Coleman Tió, Comment, Six Puerto Rican Congressmen Go to\n\nWashington, 116 Yale L.J. 1389, 1394 (2007).

That precedent, including the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in National Mutual Insurance Co. v.

By analogy, such cases support the argument\n\nthat references in Article I to the voting rights of the people of\n\n\"the States\" are not necessarily negative references to the voting\n\nrights of citizens residing in other United States jurisdictions.\n\nCf.   Adams     v.   Clinton,    90    F.    Supp.   2d    35,    95    (D.D.C.   2000)\n\n(Oberdorfer, J., dissenting in part) (\"[T]he use of the term\n\n'State' in the diversity jurisdiction clause of the Constitution\n\ncannot    mean   'and   not     of    the    District     of   Columbia.'\"      (citing\n\nTidewater)).\n\n              Moreover, the redressability concern that underlay my\n\nconcurrence in Igartúa III stemmed in large part from the courts'\n\ninability to order Congress to take the only actions that I thought\n\n\n                                            -37-\n\fcould deliver the remedy the plaintiffs sought – \"to either admit\n\nPuerto Rico as a state or to propose a Constitutional amendment\n\nallocating electors to Puerto Rico.\"      See 417 F.3d at 154.     If\n\nPuerto Rico residents' right to vote originates from a source of\n\nUnited States law other than the Constitution, however, it is\n\npossible that declaratory relief could properly involve individual\n\ngovernment officials rather than Congress.

Rather, my point is that the\n\nquestion is important and complex, and it deserves re-examination\n\nby the full court with the benefit of the best advocacy we can\n\nenlist on both sides of the issue.

Later in the decision the Court stated: \"[T]he\nUnited States ratified the Covenant on the express understanding\nthat it was not self-executing and so did not itself create\nobligations enforceable in the federal courts.\" Id. at 735. As\nJudge Torruella notes, however, both of the Supreme Court's\nobservations were dicta because \"the question of the ICCPR's self-\nexecution was never presented to the Court\" and the petitioner had\nconceded that it was not self-executing.\n       19\n          Judge Howard explained that the Senate's non-self-\nexecution declaration concerning the domestic effect of the ICCPR\nwas \"in reality[] an attempt to legislate concerning the internal\nimplementation of a treaty,\" which the Senate lacked the power to\ndo. Igartúa III, 417 F.3d at 190-91 (dissenting opinion). Judge\nHoward noted that the declaration was therefore \"merely an\nexpression of the Senate's view of domestic policy . . . [with] no\ndomestic effect.\" Id. at 191. The Supreme Court in Sosa did not\nconclude otherwise. See id. at 191 n.63 (\"Because the question in\nSosa was not the binding effect of the Senate's non-self-execution\ndeclaration in determining whether the ICCPR establishes a private\ncause of action, the parties did not present the Court with (and it\ndid not address) the separation of powers arguments questioning the\nSenate's authority to issue such declarations.\").\n\n                                   -40-\n\fJudge Torruella builds on Judge Howard's earlier decision and\n\nargues plausibly that the surrounding circumstances demonstrate\n\nthat the ICCPR should be construed as a self-executing treaty.\n\n            In 2005, my view of the case made it unnecessary for me\n\nto evaluate Judge Howard's conclusion that the courts, rather than\n\nthe Senate, have the responsibility to determine whether a treaty\n\nis self-executing.      My view was that, whatever the status of the\n\ntreaty, it was not the role of a court to declare that the\n\nplaintiffs had voting rights that were inconsistent with the\n\nlimitations built into the Constitution.              Having now accepted the\n\npossibility that the Constitution does not bar federal voting\n\nrights for Puerto Rico residents, I also must confront the ICCPR's\n\nstatus.\n\n            The passage of time has only strengthened Judge Howard's\n\nanalysis.      The    Supreme    Court       has    recently   confirmed     that\n\ndetermining whether a treaty is self-executing \"is, of course, a\n\nmatter for [the courts] to decide.\"                Medellín, 552 U.S. at 518.\n\nHence, the Senate cannot on its own \"declare\" the status of a\n\ntreaty.     As Judge Howard observed, a Senate \"'declaration is not\n\npart of a treaty in the sense of modifying the legal obligations\n\ncreated by it.        A declaration is merely an expression of an\n\ninterpretation or of a policy or position.'\" Igartúa III, 417 F.3d\n\nat   190   (quoting   Stefan    A.   Riesenfeld      &   Frederick   M.

That is so because the 2005 majority improperly rejected\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim that the treaty is self-executing without\n\nconducting an independent analysis of its language and, if the\n\nlanguage    is   unclear,    the     \"'postratification        understanding'    of\n\nsignatory nations\" and other surrounding circumstances.\n\n            Even   if   we    were    to   find   that   the    treaty    is   self-\n\nexecuting, however, difficult questions would remain.                    Among them\n\nare whether the treaty's provisions in fact oblige the United\n\nStates to provide all of its citizens the right to elect voting\n\nmembers of the House of Representatives and whether the treaty\n\nprovides for a private right of action as a vehicle for pursuing\n\nthat   right.      Also      of    consequence    is     the   unique     political\n\nrelationship between Puerto Rico and the United States government.\n\nWhether a generally stated commitment to provide the right to vote\n\nto all citizens should supersede the specific political negotiation\n\nthat has led to Puerto Rico's status is not an easily answered\n\nquestion.    The fact that the questions are difficult, however, is\n\nnot a reason to avoid them.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -43-\n\f            III. Summarizing the Prerequisites for a Claim\n\n            Unquestionably, the plaintiffs face a series of hurdles\n\nin demonstrating their entitlement to declaratory relief.                   Their\n\nclaims are much more potent, however, than Chief Judge Lynch's\n\nopinion acknowledges.           If the Constitution permits extension of\n\nvoting rights to Puerto Rico residents by means of a treaty,20 and\n\nif   the   ICCPR   is   a   self-executing       treaty    whose   terms   support\n\nassertion of a private cause of action, the plaintiffs' claims\n\ncould not be so easily dismissed.\n\n            At its core, this case is about whether a substantial\n\ngroup of United States citizens should be given a right that our\n\ncountry and the international community agree is a fundamental\n\nelement of a free society.            Article 25 of the ICCPR states, in\n\nrelevant part, that \"[e]very citizen shall have the right and the\n\nopportunity . . . [t]o vote and to be elected at genuine periodic\n\nelections    which      shall   be   by    universal      and   equal   suffrage.\"\n\n(Emphasis added.) At a minimum, given the importance of the issues\n\nand the evolving debate, fairness dictates that the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims receive considerably more deliberation than our panel is\n\nauthorized to provide.           The entire court should be engaged in\n\n\n      20\n          Whether Congress's plenary authority to regulate Puerto\nRico under the Territory Clause of the Constitution also could\nprovide a basis for such action is a question beyond the scope of\nthis case. See U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (\"The Congress\nshall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and\nRegulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to\nthe United States . . . .\").\n\n                                          -44-\n\fconsidering and resolving these issues, with the best advocacy\n\navailable   in   support   of   all   parties.   Indeed,   as    a   case\n\n\"involv[ing] a question of exceptional importance,\" this action\n\nfits squarely within the guidelines for en banc review.         See Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 35(a) (2).\n\n            Thus, while I agree that the district court's judgment\n\nmust be affirmed by the panel, I urge the court to reconsider the\n\nconstitutional and treaty issues in a new en banc proceeding.\n\n\n\n   -Opinion Concurring in Part and Dissenting in Part Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                  -45-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in part; Dissenting\n\nin part).

The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 not\n              only guaranteed the existing territories\n              eventual enfranchisement through admission\n              into the Union, but further stipulated that\n              once a territory had \"sixty thousand free\n              Inhabitants,\" it would \"be admitted by its\n              Delegates into the Congress of the United\n              States on equal footing with the original\n              States.\"     All U.S. territories acquired\n              between 1787 and the Spanish-American War also\n              achieved congressional representation through\n              statehood.\n\n                     The evidence therefore suggests that\n              territorial disenfranchisement was meant to be\n              temporary; territories would be held as\n              states-in-waiting.   Only   the    territorial\n              incorporation doctrine devised by the Insular\n              Cases permitted a sharp deviation from prior\n              practice. But holding colonies like Puerto\n              Rico without the possibility of eventual\n              enfranchisement still runs against the very\n              principles upon which the nation was founded\n              and the Constitution enacted.\n\nId. at 1394.\n\n              Given this background, the use of the term \"State\" in\n\ncertain structural provisions of the Constitution says nothing\n\nabout   the    Framers'   intentions    with   regard   to    the    apparently\n\npermanent and long-standing political inequality of citizens living\n\nin Puerto Rico for more than a century.

Apr. 2, 1992).\n\n          Article 25 of the ICCPR establishes that:\n\n          Every citizen shall     have    the   right   and\n          opportunity . . .\n\n          (a) To take part in the conduct of public\n          affairs, directly or through freely chosen\n          representatives; [and]\n\n          (b) To vote and to be elected at genuine\n          periodic elections which shall be by universal\n          and equal suffrage . . . .\n\nICCPR art. 25 (emphasis supplied).    Plainly, the continued lack of\n\npolitical representation of Appellants is a violation of the United\n\nStates' treaty obligations under Article 25.\n\n          Additionally, pursuant to Article 2(1), the United States\n\n\"undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its\n\nterritory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in\n\nthe present Covenant, without distinction of any kind.\"       Id.   Art.\n\n\n\n     34\n          The United States was a member of the Drafting Committee,\na sub-organ of the Commission on Human Rights of the United\nNations, since this committee began drafting the ICCPR at its first\nsession on June 9-25, 1947. Marc J. Bossuyt, Guide to the \"travaux\npréparatoires\" of the International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights, XIX (1987). It was not until December 16, 1966, after ten\nsessions of the Drafting Committee, and multiple drafts and\namendments, that the General Assembly adopted the ICCPR by 106\nvotes for approval, 2 votes against approval, and 38 votes of\nabstention. The ICCPR entered into force on March 23, 1976, with\n85 states becoming parties to both the ICCPR and the Optional\nProtocol by January 1, 1987. Id. at XX. The United States was not\none of them. It became a signatory party on October 5, 1977, and\na full party on June 8, 1992, after the Senate had ratified the\ntreaty.\n\n                               -64-\n\f2(1) (emphasis supplied).          The United States further agrees \"to\n\ntake the necessary steps, in accordance with its constitutional\n\nprocesses and with the provisions of the present Covenant, to adopt\n\nsuch laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to\n\nthe rights recognized in the present Covenant.\"                    Id. Art. 2(2).\n\nMost importantly, under this treaty the United States specifically\n\ncommits    itself     \"[t]o   ensure   that    any   person    whose    rights    or\n\nfreedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective\n\nremedy.\" Id. Art. 2(3) (a) (emphasis supplied).                In furtherance of\n\nthis provision the United States is obligated \"[t]o ensure that any\n\nperson     claiming    such   a   remedy    shall    have    his   right    thereto\n\ndetermined by competent judicial, administrative or legislative\n\nauthorities, or by any other competent authority provided for by\n\nthe legal system of the State, and to develop the possibilities of\n\njudicial remedy.\"       Id. (emphasis supplied).            The lead opinion, at\n\nthe government's urging, concludes that the exacting language of\n\nthe ICCPR just quoted is meaningless and ineffective, because it is\n\nallegedly \"non-executing.\"         This is an erroneous conclusion which\n\nis   the    result    of   the    court's     failure   to     live    up   to   its\n\nconstitutional duty to independently assess and interpret the\n\nmeaning of a treaty entered into by the United States.                 The Paquete\n\nHabana, 175 U.S. at 700.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -65-\n\f                        C.     The Government's opposition to the domestic\n                               application of the ICCPR\n\n                Appellants' claim for relief under the ICCPR and the\n\nSupremacy Clause is rejected on essentially three general grounds:\n\n(1) the ICCPR is not a \"self-executing\" treaty and thus does not\n\ncreate individual rights that are enforceable in federal court; (2)\n\nthe issues raised by this appeal involve \"political questions,\"\n\nwhich     the    courts      should    abstain      from   deciding;    and    (3)   no\n\n\"effective\" remedy can be granted to Appellants by the courts, and\n\ntherefore       there     is   no     \"Case   and    Controversy\"      and    we   lack\n\njurisdiction.35         The common thread that runs through these three\n\ncontentions is the fact that they are all judicially-created\n\ndoctrines, used to avoid passing upon issues that the courts may,\n\nfor a variety of reasons, wish not to confront.\n\n\n\n\n     35\n           Indeed, the repeated actions by the Government in this,\nand other similar cases, in so opposing Appellants' claims to equal\nvoting rights are in themselves flagrant violations of accords\nentered into by the United States under Article 2, paragraph 3, of\nthe ICCPR, in which it undertook \"[t]o ensure that any person whose\n[ICCPR] rights or freedoms . . . are violated shall have an\neffective remedy,\" and further agreed to ensure that these rights\nbe   \"determined   by   competent  judicial,   administrative,   or\nlegislative authorities, or by any other competent authority\nprovided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the\npossibilities of judicial remedy.\"     ICCPR art. 2(3).    Far from\nthis, the Government has consistently opposed Appellants' attempts\nto obtain an effective remedy. Furthermore, it could be argued with\nconsiderable logic that this court's repeated actions in failing to\nenforce these international commitments, themselves result in\nplacing the United States in violation of the ICCPR assurances that\nan enforceable judicial remedy would be available.\n\n                                          -66-\n\f                             (1)   The doctrine of self-execution of treaties\n                                   and its relevance to the ICCPR36\n\n                                   (a)   The doctrine     of    self-execution    of\n                                         treaties\n\n                   The doctrine of self-execution of treaties, or stated in\n\nthe negative, of non-self-execution, is a judicially-created theory\n\nwhich has, at convenient times, been used to avoid international\n\ncommitments,          particularly       where   human   rights   are   concerned.37\n\nToday, this theory promotes a rule whereby treaties are presumed to\n\nbe non-self-executing, when in fact the text and history of the\n\nSupremacy Clause counsel exactly the opposite.

Thus, Parliament must pass specific\n\nlegislation before a treaty is incorporated into the municipal law\n\nof Great Britain.38\n\n            This, of course, is different with regards to the United\n\nStates, in which the complementary constitutional roles of the\n\nPresident   and   Senate    in   the    negotiation   and   ratification   of\n\ntreaties allow intervention by both branches of government before\n\nthe treaty comes into effect and becomes part of our domestic law.\n\n\n\n\n     38\n          See J.G.

Hylton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199, 275 (1796)\n(explaining that treaties are traditionally non-self-executing in\nGreat Britain in part because \"no man living will say that a bare\nproclamation of the King, upon the ground of treaty\" is adequate\nauthority for enacting domestic law); The Parliament Belge, 4 P.D.\n129 (1879) (holding that a British treaty was non-self executing\nfor the same reasoning previously stated); Carlos Manuel Vázquez,\nTreaty-Based Rights and Remedies of Individuals, 92 Col.

See U.S.\n\nConst. art. VI, cl. 2 (\"[A]ll Treaties made, or which shall be\n\nmade, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the\n\nsupreme Law of the Land\").\n\n          The historical record sustaining this proposition is\n\nunquestionable.   During the Constitutional Convention, a proposal\n\nto the effect that treaties be sanctioned by the legislature before\n\nthey had \"the operation of law\" was specifically rejected.       See\n\nJames Madison, Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787\n\n597 (W.W. Norton 1987) (1840).   An alternative proposal, which was\n\nalso rejected, would have established two types of treaties: one\n\nrequiring only action by the President and the Senate, and a second\n\nrequiring additional action by the House of Representatives. 2 The\n\nRecords of the Federal Convention of 1787       538 (Max Farrand ed.\n\nrev. ed. 1966).   In a similar vein, the Committee on Style removed\n\nfrom the final version of the Supremacy Clause language that would\n\nhave given the national government the power to \"enforce treaties.\"\n\nThe Committee struck this language because it was redundant,\n\nconsidering the clear language of the Supremacy Clause.      Id. at\n\n389-90.   The rejection of these proposals illustrates that the\n\nlanguage of the Supremacy Clause was not coincidental, but rather\n\n\n                                 -69-\n\fchosen after due deliberation, and deliberately, to mean what it\n\nsays.\n\n           The expectation that treaties would become operative as\n\ndomestic law upon ratification is also expressed in the Federalist\n\nPapers and the ratification debates within the States.             In The\n\nFederalist No. 22, for example, Alexander Hamilton explained that\n\n\"[t]he treaties of the United States, to have any force at all,\n\nmust be considered as part of the law of the land.            Their true\n\nimport, as far as respects individuals, must, like all other laws,\n\nbe ascertained by judicial determinations.\" The Federalist No. 22,\n\nat   150   (Alexander   Hamilton)     (Clinton   Rossiter   ed.,      1961).\n\nSimilarly, at the North Carolina ratifying convention, one of the\n\nConstitution's   supporters   explained:     \"It   was    necessary    that\n\ntreaties should operate as laws on individuals.          They ought to be\n\nbinding upon us from the moment they are made.           They involve in\n\ntheir nature not only our own rights, but those of foreigners [and\n\nshould be protected by our judiciary].\"          Jordan J. Paust, Self-\n\nExecuting Treaties, 82 Am. J. Int'l L. 760, 762 (1988) (quoting 4\n\nThe Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the\n\nFederal Constitution 27 (J. Elliot ed., 1941) (1830) (documenting\n\nthe statements of William Davie, a North Carolina delegate to the\n\nConstitutional Convention) (brackets in original)).           Even those\n\nopposing ratification shared this view: \"Brutus,\" in criticizing\n\nArticle III, stated that he could \"readily comprehend what is meant\n\n\n                                    -70-\n\fby deciding a case under a treaty.

Kaminski & Gaspare J. Saladino eds., 1986).\n\n                      (iii)      The American Rule     is   modified:\n                                 Foster v. Neilson\n\n          In Foster v. Neilson, decided by Chief Justice Marshall\n\nin 1829, the Court concluded that the treaty in question was not\n\nself-executing because, by its terms, it did not establish a right\n\nin the individual claimant, but rather placed an obligation on the\n\nlegislative branch to act.    27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 314-15 (1829),\n\noverruled in part by United States v. Perchman, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 51\n\n(1833).   Although the Foster rule has since come into vogue,\n\nparticularly in denying the application of human rights treaties,39\n\nproperly applied it is a rule that makes sense, for a treaty is\n\nwhat amounts to a contract between nations, and as such, what needs\n\nto be done at the outset, as in the case of a contract between\n\n\n\n     39\n          See Louis Henkin, U.S. Ratification of Human Rights\nConventions: The Ghost of Senator Briker, 89 Am.

In Medellín, the Court held\n\nthat an executive memorandum purporting to grant individuals rights\n\nunder a non-self-executing agreement was invalid because, while\n\n\"[t]he President has an array of political and diplomatic means\n\navailable to enforce international obligations . . . unilaterally\n\nconverting a non-self-executing treaty into a self-executing one is\n\nnot   among   them.    The   responsibility      for    transforming     an\n\ninternational obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty\n\ninto domestic law falls to Congress,\" through, for example, the\n\nenactment of implementing legislation.        552 U.S. at 525-26.       The\n\nCourt explained:\n\n          The requirement that Congress, rather than the\n          President, implement a non-self-executing\n          treaty   derives   from   the  text   of   the\n          Constitution, which divides the treaty-making\n          power between the President and the Senate.\n          The Constitution vests the President with the\n          authority to \"make\" a treaty.          If the\n          Executive determines that a treaty should have\n          domestic effect of its own force, that\n          determination may be implemented in \"mak[ing]\"\n          the treaty, by ensuring that it contains\n          language   plainly   providing  for   domestic\n\n                                   -79-\n\f          enforceability. If the treaty is to be\n          self-executing in this respect, the Senate\n          must consent to the treaty by the requisite\n          two-thirds vote, consistent with all other\n          constitutional restraints.\n\nId. at 526 (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).          Thus, as\n\nthe Supreme Court has reinforced, the constitutional prerogative to\n\n\"make\" treaties, and to set their domestic legal effect, falls in\n\nthe first instance to the executive.         While the Senate's views\n\nregarding self-execution may be relevant to the interpretation of\n\nan ambiguous treaty, see Stuart, 489 U.S. at 366-8; Restatement\n\n(Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 314, cmt.\n\nd (1987) (\"indication that . . . the Senate ascribed a particular\n\nmeaning to the treaty is relevant to the interpretation of the\n\ntreaty by a United States court in much the same way that the\n\nlegislative   history    of   a    statute    is    relevant      to   its\n\ninterpretation\"),48 those views are not capable of supplanting the\n\n\n     48\n          Nonetheless,   as   Justice    Scalia    points   out   in   his\nconcurrence in Stuart:\n\n          Of course the Senate has unquestioned power to\n          enforce its own understanding of treaties.

If these\n          are agreed to by the President and accepted by\n          the other contracting parties, they become\n          part of the treaty and of the law of the\n          United States. If they are not agreed to by\n          the President, his only constitutionally\n          permissible course is to decline to ratify the\n          treaty, and his ratification without the\n          conditions would presumably provide the basis\n          for impeachment.

The lead opinion's reliance on Sosa illustrates\n\nhis point.   In its haste to dispose of Appellant's treaty-based\n\nclaims, the en banc majority all but abandoned the Supreme Court's\n\nestablished plain-text approach to questions of self-execution, and\n\nturned on its head the Treaty Clause's careful separation of\n\npowers.   See U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2 (\"[The President]\n\nshall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,\n\nto make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present\n\nconcur . . . .\")\n\n          It is appropriate at this time to bypass and correct this\n\ndecision not only because, as admitted by the lead opinion, it was\n\nbased on dicta in Sosa, see op. at 29, but also because more recent\n\nSupreme Court precedent places its bare majority conclusions in\n\n\n                               -82-\n\fserious doubt. The political ties between the United States and its\n\nterritories have continued to evolve and have become ever more\n\nintegrated.   Cf. Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 758 (\"It may well be that\n\nover time the ties between the United States and any of its\n\nunincorporated      Territories    strengthen   in   ways   that   are   of\n\nconstitutional significance.\").            The only thing that has not\n\nchanged is the political inequality of the class of United States\n\ncitizens residing in Puerto Rico.          I would hold that the task of\n\ndetermining whether the ICCPR is self-executing, and gives rise to\n\nenforceable rights, is for the courts. The lead opinion's reliance\n\non dicta in Sosa essentially prevents that examination. As will be\n\nshown, recourse to the plain language of that treaty, and to its\n\ndrafting history, demonstrates that it is in fact a self-executing\n\nagreement that, upon ratification, became the Law of the Land and\n\nthus must be enforced by this court.\n\n                    (b)   The plain language of the ICCPR counsels\n                          that individual rights were created and that\n                          the United States agreed to provide a forum\n                          and remedies for the vindication of those\n                          rights to those of its citizens who claim a\n                          violation of those rights.\n\n            The text of the ICCPR unequivocally spells out individual\n\nrights and establishes the obligations of the contracting parties\n\nregarding   their    enforcement   by   individual   citizens   who   claim\n\nviolations of these rights.         A straightforward reading of this\n\nlanguage should leave little doubt that the United States has\n\nentered into an international agreement creating individual rights\n\n                                    -83-\n\fipso facto: at a minimum, the United States has agreed that\n\n\"[e]very citizen shall have the right and opportunity . . . [t]o\n\nvote . . . at genuine and periodic elections which shall be by\n\nuniversal and equal suffrage.\"    ICCPR art. 25, para. b (emphasis\n\nadded).   Upon ratification of this treaty by the Senate, these\n\nrights have become the supreme law of the land.        Further, the\n\nUnited States has agreed to provide an effective remedy for the\n\nviolation of these rights.   Id. art 2, para. 3 (emphasis added).\n\nMoreover, the United States \"undert[ook] to respect and ensure [the\n\nright to vote of] all individuals within its territory and subject\n\nto its jurisdiction . . . without distinction . . .\"    Id. at art.\n\n2, para. 1.    Further, it agreed \"that any person claiming such a\n\nremedy shall have the right thereto determined by competent,\n\njudicial, administrative, or legislative authorities, or by any\n\nother competent authority provided for by the legal system of the\n\nState, and to develop possibilities of judicial remedies.\" Id. art\n\n2, para. 3 (emphasis added).      Nonetheless, in contravention of\n\nthese obligations, the United States government has not only failed\n\nto act in support of the same, but it has actively obstructed their\n\nrealization.

See\n\nU.S. Const. amend.

This inaction is in clear violation of the United States'\n\nobligations under the ICCPR.\n\n\n        51\n          Further, in 1977, the year in which the Carter\nadministration first submitted the ICCPR to the Senate for\nratification, Congress passed a proposed constitutional amendment\nthat would have granted the District of Columbia congressional\nvoting representation \"as if it were a state.\" See H.R.J.

See\n\ngenerally Bossuyt, supra note 16. Illustrative of this is the\n\nReport of the Commission on Human Rights, 5th Session (1949), 9th\n\nSession (1953), which addresses the formulation of political rights\n\nunder what eventually became article 25 of the ICCPR.           The report\n\nstates:\n\n           Two formulae were proposed: \"Every citizen\n           . . . shall be guaranteed by the State the\n           right and the opportunity [to vote]\" and\n           \"Every citizen shall have the right and the\n           opportunity [to vote],\" the former emphasizing\n           the obligation of the State, the latter the\n           rights of the citizen. The latter wording was\n           adopted.\n\nBossuyt, supra note 16, at 471 (internal citations omitted).\n\n           In a later discussion of Article 25, paragraph (b)\n\n(providing the right \"[t]o vote . . . at genuine periodic elections\n\nwhich shall be by universal and equal suffrage\"), the Report\n\nstates:\n\n           The various requirements of the article that\n           elections must be \"genuine,\" \"periodic,\" \"by\n           universal and equal suffrage,\" and \"by secret\n           ballot\" did not give rise to much discussion,\n           except for the words \"universal and equal\n           suffrage.\" The opinion was expressed that the\n           word \"universal\" was redundant in the light\n           of the introductory clause, \"Every citizen\n           shall have the right;\" so was the word\n           \"equal\", in view of the reference to the non-\n           discrimination clause of article 2.       The\n           majority,   however,   considered  that   the\n           principle of \"universal and equal suffrage\"\n\n                                   -89-\n\f            was a most fundamental one, and decided to\n            include it in the article. This provision, it\n            was thought, would leave States parties to the\n            Covenant free to regulate their own electoral\n            system, provided each vote carried equal\n            weight.\n\nId.   at   474-75   (internal   citations   omitted).     Article   25   was\n\napproved at the 1096th meeting of the Third Committee, 16th Session\n\n(1961), by a vote of 71 to none, with 4 abstentions.            See id. at\n\n477; A/C.3/SR.1096, § 79.\n\n            A proposal by the United States at the Second Session of\n\nthe Commission regarding the enforcement of the rights created by\n\nthe ICCPR pursuant to Article 2 also sheds light on the intentions\n\nof the United States regarding both the question of self-execution\n\nand the enforcement of these rights by the courts of the United\n\nStates.     In its proposal, E/CN.4/37, the United States moved to\n\nhave Article 2 read:\n\n            Each High Contracting         Party   is   under   an\n            obligation to ensure:\n\n            a) that its law secure to all persons under\n            its jurisdiction, including citizens . . .,\n            the enjoyment of these human rights and\n            fundamental freedoms;\n\n            b) that any person whose rights or freedoms\n            are violated shall have an effective remedy,\n            whether the violation has been committed by\n            persons acting in an official capacity;\n\n\n\n\n                                   -90-\n\f            c) that such remedies shall be enforceable by\n            a judiciary whose independence is secured\n            . . . .53\n\nBossuyt, supra note 16, at 49 (emphasis added) (quoting U.N. Doc\n\nE/CN.4/37).     Although this exact language was not approved, it\n\nshows what the United States was attempting to achieve through this\n\ntreaty.\n\n            The provision of effective remedies under Article 2 for\n\nviolation of the individual rights established by ICCPR was the\n\nsubject of much discussion and debate, and also reflects the intent\n\nof   the   contracting   parties,   including   the   United   States,   in\n\nenacting the ICCPR.       The representative of France was of the\n\nopinion that \"there was no need to specify the obligations of the\n\nStates parties in the event of a violation of the covenant, since\n\nit was obvious that if the States undertook to abide by the\n\ncovenant, they would have to provide for effective remedies against\n\n\n      53\n          Commission on Human Rights, 2nd Session (1947) (emphasis\nsupplied). At a later session of the Commission, the United States\nmade a proposal that would have inserted into paragraph 2 of\nArticle 2, a statement to the effect that \"[t]he provisions of this\nCovenant shall not themselves become effective as domestic law.\"\nSee Bossuyt, supra note 16, at 62 (quoting U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/224).\nThe United States \"contended that in some States a ratified treaty\nbecame the supreme law of the country in accordance with its\nconstitution,\" while \"[i]n others a treaty was not automatically\nincorporated in the national legislation, but its provisions had to\nbe included in legislation in order that they might become\nenforceable within the country.\" Id. Although the United States\nargued that its proposal was intended to put all the States on\nequal footing, its proposal was rejected. The Philippines made a\ncounter-proposal which provided the substance of the language of\nthe text eventually adopted. Amendment E/CN.4/318 (PI); see also\nBossuyt, supra note 16, at 62.\n\n                                    -91-\n\finfringements.\"       E/CN.4SR.125, p.4 (F); Bossuyt, supra note 16, at\n\n64 (discussing Commission on Human Rights, 5th Session (1949), 6th\n\nSession (1950), 8th Session (1952)).                  Great Britain, whose views\n\nwere   eventually         generally    accepted,       argued     that    \"the    proper\n\nenforcement of the provisions of the covenant depended on the\n\nguarantees     of    the     individual's       rights       against     abuse,    which\n\n[required the assurance of] the following elements: [1] possession\n\nof a legal remedy, [2] the granting of this remedy by national\n\nauthorities and [3] the enforcement of the remedy by the competent\n\nauthorities.\" E/CN.4/SR.125, p.8 (GB) (emphasis added);                      Bossuyt,\n\nsupra note 16, at 64.\n\n             These    views     were    reinforced          in   the   discussion    of\n\nParagraph    2(b)    of     Article    2.       As    originally       proposed,    this\n\nprovision stated that any person whose rights were violated would\n\nhave   his   or     her    rights     determined       by    competent     \"political,\n\nadministrative, or judicial\" authorities.                   Bossuyt, supra note 16,\n\nat 67 (quoting A12929, Ch. V, § 16).                 It was the opinion of some --\n\nincluding France, Egypt, Denmark, and the United States -- that\n\n\"all remedy should be provided through recourse to independent\n\njudicial authorities, which would include, where that was the case,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -92-\n\fadministrative tribunals.\"54   Bossuyt, supra note 16, at 67 (citing\n\nE/CN.4/SR 195 §6 (USA)).\n\n          It was considered particularly undesirable\n          that a person whose freedoms had been\n          violated, in all probability by the political\n          authorities of the State, should have his\n          right to a remedy determined by a political\n          organ, since the very same organ that had\n          violated his right might be the one that was\n          adjudicating his claim for a remedy.\n\nId. (citing E/CN.4/SR.138, §74-75 (USA)).55\n\n          The negotiating history of the ICCPR reinforces the clear\n\nlanguage of this treaty establishing individual, enforceable rights\n\non behalf of persons situated as are Appellants, and obligating the\n\nUnited States to provide a judicial remedy in its courts to\n\n\n     54\n          It should be noted that in many European legal systems\nand those modeled after them, including France, administrative\ntribunals play an important role in deciding what we normally\nconsider constitutional law in the United States.\n     55\n          This concern was again repeated before the Third\nCommittee's 18th Session in 1983 by the representatives from Great\nBritain, Italy, India and Australia, who sought to keep the\nremedies \"expressly reserved to an independent judiciary, and where\napplicable, to administrative tribunals.\" Id. at 69. Saudi Arabia\nthen proposed substituting \"legislative\" for \"political\" in the\noriginal language, A/C.3/SR.1259, §3 (SA) §10 (Chairman); Bossuyt,\nsupra note 16, at 69. After some parliamentary maneuvering, Saudi\nArabia's proposal was amended to read \"competent judicial,\nadministrative, or legislative or by any other competent authority\nprovided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the\npossibilities of a judicial remedy,\" thus allowing a remedy to be\ngranted by the executive, as well as by action of parliamentary\ncommissions or ad hoc legislation designed to remedy a specific\nwrong,   yet   avoiding   the  use   of   the   word   \"political.\"\nA/C.3/SR.1259, § 12 (SA), § 24 (UAR); Bossuyt, supra note 16, at\n69.

The doctrine\n\nhas been much criticized because it is applied ad hoc and is, in\n\neffect, a brand of judicial activism that abdicates the courts'\n\nconstitutional       responsibility         to    pass    upon     constitutional\n\nquestions.

Any\n\npolitical questions of relevance to this case have already been\n\ndecided by the appropriate political branches: the Executive, which\n\nnegotiated the terms of ICCPR, and Congress, which through the\n\nSenate exercised its constitutional prerogative of granting its\n\nadvice   and   consent   to   this   treaty.

But the effect of the ICCPR's self-executing\n\nprovisions is that Congress and the President have already granted\n\nthe United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico such rights.\n\nFurthermore, and more to the point, the United States has agreed\n\n\"to take the necessary steps, in accordance with its constitutional\n\n\n\n       57\n          Because Appellants are seeking to vindicate their rights\nunder the ICCPR -- which, as discussed, has become domestic law\nthrough operation of the Supremacy Clause and gives rise to\nenforceable, individual rights -- and because it is beyond dispute\nthat the ongoing denial of those rights is traceable to actions and\ninactions of the United States, the other elements of standing are\nclearly satisfied in this case.

In Franklin, a\n\nplaintiff challenged the method used by the Secretary of Commerce\n\nto calculate the population of each state for census purposes as\n\n\"arbitrary and capricious\" and contrary to certain statutes.                 Id.\n\nat 790-91.     In so doing, he sought to require the Secretary to\n\nrecalculate    the    population     numbers,   in   the     hope   that     this\n\nrecalculation would ultimately lead to a reapportionment that would\n\nassign an additional Representative to his own State.                  Id.   The\n\nCourt found that the plaintiff had stated a redressable injury. As\n\na plurality of the Court explained, \"even though [the Secretary]\n\ncannot herself change the reapportionment, she has an interest in\n\nlitigating its accuracy,\" and therefore, as a practical matter, \"we\n\nmay assume it is substantially likely that the President and other\n\nexecutive     and    congressional     officials     would     abide    by     an\n\n\n                                     -98-\n\fauthoritative     interpretation     of    the     census   statute   and\n\nconstitutional provision . . . even though they would not be\n\ndirectly bound by such a determination.\"           Id. at 803 (opinion of\n\nO'Connor, J.); see also Evans, 536 U.S. at 460 (noting that, in\n\nFranklin, \"[e]ight Members of the Court found that the plaintiff\n\nhad standing\").\n\n          Later, in Evans, the Court revisited this topic when the\n\nState of Utah sought an injunction ordering the Secretary              of\n\nCommerce to recalculate the 2000 census numbers and recertify the\n\nofficial result, believing that \"the Secretary's recertification,\n\nas a practical matter, would likely lead to a new, more favorable,\n\napportionment of Representatives.\"             536 U.S. at 460-61.     The\n\nSupreme Court rejected the argument that the plaintiff lacked a\n\nredressable injury because \"court-ordered relief\" could not extend\n\nbeyond   the    Secretary's   report      to     reapportionment   itself,\n\nexplaining:\n\n          [W]e believe it likely that Utah's victory\n          here would bring about the ultimate relief\n          that Utah seeks. Victory would mean a\n          declaration   leading,    or   an   injunction\n          requiring, the Secretary to substitute a new\n          \"report\" for the old one. Should the new\n          report contain a different conclusion about\n          the relative populations of North Carolina and\n          Utah, the relevant calculations and consequent\n          apportionment-related steps would be purely\n          mechanical . . . . Under these circumstances,\n          it would seem, as in Franklin, \"substantially\n          likely that the President and other executive\n          and congressional officials would abide by an\n          authoritative interpretation of the census\n          statute and constitutional provision . . . .\"\n\n                                   -99-\n\f            Moreover,   in   terms   of   our   \"standing\"\n            precedent, the courts would have ordered a\n            change in a legal status (that of the\n            \"report\"), and the practical consequence of\n            that change would amount to a significant\n            increase in the likelihood that the plaintiff\n            would obtain relief that directly redresses\n            the injury suffered.

In Juda II, the\n\ncourt, invoking its duty to interpret international agreements,\n\npersuaded the political branches of government to take action\n\nconsistent with those agreements.                The issue in that case was\n\nwhether, as a matter of international law, the United States could\n\nunilaterally terminate its trusteeship over the Marshall Islands\n\n\n                                        -102-\n\fand other Pacific island territories, without securing the prior\n\napproval of the UN Security Council.          After stating what is by now\n\nan axiomatic constitutional rule, namely, that \"[c]ourts of the\n\nUnited States have final authority to interpret an international\n\nagreement for purposes of applying it as law in the United States,\"\n\nJuda II, 13 Cl. Ct. at 678, the court held that the actions of the\n\nPresident and Congress to resolve the status of the Pacific Island\n\nTrust Territories had resulted in de facto, but not de jure,\n\ncompliance by the United States with its treaty obligations.             Id.\n\nat 682.\n\n               The ruling granted declaratory relief to the citizens of\n\nthe trust territory who had challenged the validity of Presidential\n\nProclamation 5564, which had pronounced that the trusteeship was no\n\nlonger in effect.         Presidential Proclamation 5564, sec. 1, Fed.\n\nReg. 51, at 40399 (November 1986).             Although the court did not\n\ngrant, on other grounds, the specific relief requested by the trust\n\nterritory citizens, the court agreed that the Proclamation was not\n\nin compliance with international obligations of the United States,\n\nincluding the UN Charter.          Juda II, 13 Cl. Ct. at 678-682.\n\n               In response to this declaration, the United States took\n\nsteps     to    comply    with   these   international    obligations,   and\n\neventually sought and received the UN Security Council's approval\n\nfor its actions on November 10, 1992.            In the intervening seven-\n\nyear    period,     the   United    States    complied   with   the   Court's\n\n\n                                      -103-\n\fdisposition of the case, notwithstanding the fact that the Court\n\ndid not retain jurisdiction over the controversy.            The court also\n\nrejected the government's argument to the effect that the Insular\n\nCases58 precluded the application of the Constitution to the Trust\n\nTerritory, concluding instead that, even in a territory with a non-\n\ncitizen population, governed under a treaty with the United Nations\n\nrather than as a result of annexation (as in the case of Puerto\n\nRico),    \"[t]he    concept   that    the    Bill   of   Rights   and   other\n\nconstitutional protections against arbitrary government are to be\n\napplied selectively on a territorial basis cannot be justified in\n\nthe 1980's.\"       Juda I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cl.

This is good\n\nadvice which unfortunately has fallen on deaf ears in this Circuit.\n\n           As the Juda cases demonstrate, the argument made in the\n\npresent controversy, that a declaratory judgment may not proceed\n\nbecause there is a lack of an effective remedy, creating a non-\n\njusticiable case and controversy because there is no assurance that\n\nthe government or Congress will take any action based on such a\n\ndeclaration, is unavailing.

Conclusion\n\n          As the Supreme Court has recognized:\n\n          No right is more precious in a free country\n          than that of having a voice in the election of\n          those who make the laws under which, as good\n          citizens, we must live.    Other rights, even\n          the most basic, are illusory if the right to\n          vote is undermined.\n\n                               -105-\n\fWesberry v.

Allowing\n\nthe creation of a second class of U.S citizens on a permanent, or\n\neven indefinite, basis is not a proper exercise of the power of\n\nCongress    under   the   Territorial   Clause60   or   the   Naturalization\n\nClause.61\n\n            The fact is that the United States assumed obligations\n\nunder the ICCPR that were undoubtedly aimed at the correction of\n\ninequality, and in particular, political inequality, among its\n\ncitizenry.    There is no question, nor does the government dispute,\n\nthat the United States has not complied with its obligations under\n\nthe ICCPR to recognize these rights, and to provide remedies for\n\ntheir enforcement when, and where, appropriate.
